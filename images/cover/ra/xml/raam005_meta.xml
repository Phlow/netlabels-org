  <description>navarro from paris (.fr) melts nature sounds with digital ambience into melodic tunes, that generate a french atmosphere of "savoir vivre".

besides his studies in anthropology, specialising in history of ideas and religion, he studied electroacoustics and concrete music at cnr (conservatoire national de r√©gion).
he composed for different art projects, the videogame laracroft and various exhibitions supported by the fonds national d'arts contemporains (fnac), which were shown all over the world.

now living in paris, he decided to concentrate on melodies, playing guitar and producing his own soundscapes. his debut album is full of bright tones and digital lightness.

perfect music for autumn evenings, sitting in the garden and drinking a good glass of french red wine.</description>
