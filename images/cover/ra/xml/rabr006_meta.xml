  <description>starfrosch is a collective from bern (.ch) bringing us a 
surprisingly popesque and very playful release.

in addition starfrosch is also a platform for podcasting, netaudio-news, networking and a gamecenter. according to douglas adams "hitchhikers guide to the galaxy", frogstar world b is the planet which plans the restaurant at the end of the universe.

that's where we all would like to go, to hear jeannie casey (voc) and carina schilling (voc) unfold their voices, and sing themself into the souls of the listeners. while christoph geissbühler (piano), markus koller (laptop), adriano schneider (guitar) and daniel schärer (bass) are concentrating on groove and harmony during their recording sessions. those guys don't talk about musical biographies, but instead feel like they were born with their instruments and play. and their tonal diversity is best reflected in the music.

explore what starfrosch is even more.</description>
