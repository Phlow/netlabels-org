  <description>thomas jaldemark from jönköping (.se) made a brilliant reflection of the contemporary times, the increasing polarity in worldwide politics, and as one result of it the unnecessary armed-attack of iraq. regardless the misery of the thematics, his dark and clean ambient unfolds warm chords as a sign of hope and is full of variations and details.

besides his projects in industrial-music and the track for the realaudio-ambient-compilation, thomas jaldemark already released ambient as "etcetc" on autoplate.org and thinnerism.com. currently living in berlin he concentrates on his software only production studio.

four consequent and individual ambient-scapes, produced by one of the founders of thinnerism.com, getting deeper with every listen.</description>
