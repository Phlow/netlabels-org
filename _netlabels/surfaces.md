surfaces netlabel is operating since september 2003

this site has been created as a virtual platform for releasing out-of-frames music by promising lithuanian sound artists in the musical fields of electronica, ambient, idm, noise, industrial, avant-garde, experimental, freejazz, and so forth

the label was introduced with the first release, a v/a featuring ten tracks ranging from ambient to nu-dub. 3 tracks from it were included in an mp3 mix titled "ambient architextures ii", released by an authoritative net-culture magazine phlow.net. after two more full-length releases, a very talented sound constructor named federico monti has asked if surfaces would release his music. the demo cd he sent had some splendid soundscapes on it, so a decision was made to change surfaces from a purely lithuanian netlabel into an international one, still with an emphasis on lithuanian music

the aim for the future is to continue releasing experiment-based quality music and diversify the style range of our releases. we are looking for composers working in the fields of avant-jazz, post-rock, indie and nu-exotica, as well as electronic musicians. we are also considering the possibility to release videos alongside with sound

surfaces netlabel is very thankful to jenty (for site hosting), internet archive (for mp3 hosting and support), phlow.net (for support and promotion), sutemos.net (for promotion in lithuania), all the people who write us encouraging comments, and all the artists who make the existence of this netlabel possible

greetings also go to all other netlabels! open-source audio definitely has its future, given the superb quality sound art many of them release!
