8bitpeoples is a netlabel based on the principle of pushing technical and creative boundaries. Founded in 1999, it was born out of an appreciation for the unique aesthetic character of early-generation computers and video game systems, and the belief that hardware has a lifetime measured in decades, not months. Like the subculture we seek to represent, we reject intended use and planned obsolescence â€” champions of forgotten tech, hijacking the future.
