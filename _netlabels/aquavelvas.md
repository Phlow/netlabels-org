The Aquavelvas is a non-profit netlabel formed in 2004 by Karsten Lange Fischer (Felix) and Thomas Alexander Vaags (Roleks). We offer electronic music in free mp3 format.

Our aim is to cover a wide array of music, focusing on experimentation outside of the established electronica genres, and cooperation and exchange of ideas in between our artists.

From our very first release our music has received acclaim from both inside and outside of the netlabel community. We have been featured in several major publications, both online and offline, as well as receiving repeated airplay on online and offline radio stations.


### Leader, Founder: Felix from Oslo, Norway

Felix came up with the idea of starting this netlabel, as well as our name. He now functions as the leader of the gang, and also does quality assurance on all our releases.

### Graphic artist: Sprocket from Trondheim, Norway

Sprocket designed our logo and many of our cover images. He was also heavily involved in the design of the website.

### Musician, Editor, Web developer, Founder: Roleks from Trondheim, Norway

Roleks is one of our artists, and co-founded the netlabel together with Felix. He's also responsible for the website and the textual content on it.
