## what is ambient electronic music?

ambient often means different things to different people. read the ambient music article on wikipedia to see just how widely the term is applied.

the ansiform flavor of ambient is unobtrusive, beatless, finely textured, and stable. many tracks in our collection demonstrate inspiration drawn from disparate genres such as noise, dub or pop music. it's ideal for sleeping, meditating, and cleansing the aural palate.
