Based in Wales, Serein is a record label founded in October of 2005 as a venture to promote artists and their work online. The label's output was originally made available to download for free, but in the interest of continued growth, a decision was made in early 2009 to explore some carefully considered commercial avenues. 

## New Serein Era

From the website (2015-08-01)

»Serein is a record label from Wales run by me, Huw Roberts. Founded in 2005, the label initially functioned as a net-label, all releases were made available for free under the Creative Commons license.

The label underwent a kind of reincarnation in 2009. Old releases were [archived][1] and the focus shifted to producing physical copies of new releases. From 2009 to 2013, three CD albums, four vinyl EPs and one LP were released. These are found under the active [releases][2] page.

The name Serein was taken from a meteorological dictionary, it is used to describe 'fine rain falling from a clear sky after sunset'. I pronounce it seh-rain, you can say it however you want.«
