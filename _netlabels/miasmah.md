Miasmah music is a free mp3 label dedicated to spreading inspirational / environmental / atmospheric / individual and related music, without having to go through a large printing/advertising process.. Instead delivering directly to the listener. (wherever in the world he/she may be) Miasmah was started as a downtempo/triphop label, but is now trying to move further into new landscapes of the underground scene. Miasmah music is interested in everything from experimental soundscapes/cinematic textures to lofi/abstract/hiphop and modern folk sounds.
