Epsilonlab is a Montreal-based audio-visual label dedicated to promotion of innovative electronic music and digital art. Releases include CDs, DVDs and a constantly-evolving repertoire of downloadable audio-visual files.

Epsilonlab is particularly known for integrating music with visuals during live performances and on DVD. Founded in December of 2000, Epsilonlab was initially a collective of musicians, VJs, designers and contemporary dancers devoted to live audio-visual experiments in immersive environments. The collectives Group Therapies became something of a legend in the Montreal scene and helped establish a vibrant community of like-minded VJs and electronic music producers.
