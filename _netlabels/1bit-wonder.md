Yippee! One more netlabel. Just more music that has to be thrown away on the net for free as it is not good enough to come out on a "real label"? Totally wrong: We run 1bit wonder because we want to release music without any restraints. Music that we think deserves more than to circulate tape wise through the same car radios all the time. And nevertheless, we - probably like every other netlabel as well - will try to show that "free culture" does not mean "worthless" but instead can be a highly qualitative alternative to the deadlocked machinery of music industry.

Used to deejay some years ago: Preferably experimental techno such as the Zhark Records releases, later moved to deephouse. Founded his project "Latex Distortion" together with a friend named Zacke. Still doing weird stuff with this alias. Releasing solo as well - as "Kultobjekt". Loves movies, music, beer.
