> Big beat is a style of electronic dance music that typically uses heavy breakbeats and synthesizer-generated loops and patterns common to acid house. The term has been used since the mid-1990s by the British music press to describe music by artists such as The Prodigy, The Chemical Brothers, Fatboy Slim, The Crystal Method, Propellerheads, Cut La Roc, Basement Jaxx and Groove Armada.
