> Dub techno is a subgenre of techno. Basic Channel are largely credited with defining the style. The origins of dub techno can be traced back to experimentation by Basic Channel in 1990s Berlin, as they sought to combine the rhythmic elements of stripped-down Detroit techno with the dub recording process and effects of Jamaican dub reggae.
