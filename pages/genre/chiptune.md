> A chiptune, also known as chip music or 8-bit music, is synthesized electronic music which is 1) made for PSG sound chips (real or emulated) used in vintage computers, consoles, and arcade machines or 2) tracker format music which intentionally sounds similar to old PSG chip music or 3) music that combines PSG sounds and modern electronica/EDM music styles.
