> Electro (short for either electro-funk, or electro-boogie)[3][4] is a genre of electronic music and early hip hop directly influenced by the use of TR-808 drum machines,[5][6] and funk sampling.[7][8] Records in the genre typically feature drum machines and heavy electronic sounds, usually without vocals, although if vocals are present they are delivered in a deadpan manner, often through electronic distortion such as vocoding and talkboxing.
