> Drum & Bass (also written as Drum 'n' Bass or Drum and Bass and commonly abbreviated to D&B, DnB or D'n'B) is a genre of electronic music also known as Jungle which emerged in England in the early 1990s. The genre is characterized by fast breakbeats (typically between 150â€“180 beats per minute) with heavy bass and sub-bass lines. The "bass line" is usually created with sampled sources or synthesizers.
