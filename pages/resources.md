## Scene.org

<img src="{{ site.urlimg }}/pages/logo-scene-org-small.jpg" class="right" alt="">[Scene.org][4] (also known as The International Scene Organization) is a non-profit organization, providing the currently largest [demoscene][5] file repository. Scene.org hosts many releases of demos as well as music related to the demoscene. For a long time Scene.org was the first place to look out for netlabel music releases because Scene.org gave netlabels FTP-space to store their releases. The Scene.org servers are hosted in Rotterdam, at the local university. They measure 150-200 GB of traffic each day (as of May 2006) and host about 1.1 TB of demoscene-related data (as of June 2013).
