## Scene.org

<img src="{{ site.urlimg }}/pages/logo-scene-org-256x.jpg" class="right" alt="">[Scene.org][4] (also known as The International Scene Organization) is a non-profit organization, providing the currently largest [demoscene][5] file repository. Scene.org hosts many releases of demos as well as music related to the demoscene. For a long time Scene.org was the first place to look out for netlabel music releases because Scene.org gave netlabels FTP-space to store their releases. The Scene.org servers are hosted in Rotterdam, at the local university. They measure 150-200 GB of traffic each day (as of May 2006) and host about 1.1 TB of demoscene-related data (as of June 2013).



## Archive.org

<img src="{{ site.urlimg }}/pages/logo-internet-archive-300x248.jpg" class="right" alt="">Since July 2003 Archive.org gives netlabels a home for their creative commons music releases. *»Internet Archive is a non-profit library of millions of free books, movies, software, music, and more.«* Without the help of Archive.org netlabel culture would starve in the corners of the web. Even while lot of netlabels are gone forever, you still find their music on [archive.org/details/netlabels][3].



## Sonic Squirrel

»[sonicsquirrel.net][2] is a platform and distribution channel for netlabels. Its aim is to promote free music and help artists and netlabels make their work easily available for a wider audience. sonicsquirrel.net is not only about providing music, but also about giving background information and sensitizing people for issues like copyleft/right, drm and netaudio.

the goal is to make finding and downloading free music easier than commercial distributed music, mytunes instead of itunes. the platform is meant to be an extension to the already existing archives, catalogues and magazines. our aim is to provide a user-friendly tool to find audio material.

the sonicsquirrel.net platform was started in summer 2005 as a side-project of an experimental two-week radio session.«



## Free Music Archive

»The [Free Music Archive][1] is an interactive library of high-quality, legal audio downloads.  The Free Music Archive is being directed by WFMU, the most renowned freeform radio station in America.  Radio has always offered the public free access to new music. The Free Music Archive is a continuation of that purpose, designed for the age of the internet.«
