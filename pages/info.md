title: "What is Netlabels.org?"
teaser: "It all started years ago with a passion for free minds, freedom and first of all my love for music. The term <em>netlabel</em> and its idea was still unfamiliar to most music lovers. My first contact to netlabels was – I guess – in 2000. I discovered my first netlabels through a then very active and friednly mailing list called <em>Netaudio</em>."

My desire to collect information about netlabels, to get an overview of the phenomenon was big and I started my first list. Back then it was already difficult to keep up with all the netlabels. I think the list collected some 50 to 100 netlabels.

The next step was the so-called *The Netlabel Catalogue*. Its first iteration was a CMS where I collected the information and it still was too much to do, so I made the – then clever step – to open up the Netlabel Catalogue and I used a wiki.

This wiki grew and a little community of netlabels worldwide used the netlabel catalogue to present themselves, their new releases and their back catalogue. It was a well-loved resource.

Unfortunately more and more hackers and spammers tried to rip the catalogue apart and finally suceeded. While it was a little side project I had not the nerves to repair and secure it all the time. I didn't know how to handle the attacks and finally turned it off.

In all the following years I researched an easy way to build the catalogue again. I even paid a programmer to build a unique CMS for me, but I had no money to spend it on a free resource with creative commons music, where there is no chance of financing the project to do it properly.



## A fresh restart with GitHub

Now I have a new idea: I will try to build Netlabels.org from the ground up. It will be a static resource build with the help of [GitHub][1], a platform for programmers. It will be some work for the netlabels, but I think it's worth the effort and it's save and it's the open source-way.

Let's try it!
