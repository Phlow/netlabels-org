title: "A long overdue re-start"
teaser: "Netlabels.org was a truly sorry place for some time. I had to turn of the wiki because hackers and spammers don't care about culture. They destroy. And if you aren't on your toes and keep attention all the time, you'll sometime return and everything went to waste... This time, the restart will be build on static files. Undestructable with the help of GitHub."

First of all: Please be patient.

Next, I would like to build the infrastructure day-by-day for the archive and the new generation of the netlabel catalogue. While this is a »little« project in my spare time, it will take some time to build everything. I think it will take one year to bring all my collected information online.

So, this is the first step.

Yours, mo.
