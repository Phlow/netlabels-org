Good and evil. Beauty and madness. That´s our world and we are in the center of it. We celebrate this with the new release from
Kollektiv Turmstrasse "Verrueckte Welt". 10 tracks which can´t be more different than this. Standing for everyday life and doing of the two artists of no-response. Kollektiv Turmstrasse takes you on a free ride without return, turbulences inclusive. From vents to ramplings, everything is in and on it. Accompany the two on their crazy trip...Have fun and thank you for listening.
