Strange vox samples, warm 303 lines, chemical beats, as well as dub elements in a strange minimalistic way are characteristical for Yatsuo
Motoki's music.

We know already from a previous release on stadtgrün, that the guys from Yatsuo Motoki create wonderful music. Now we have the pleasure to preset their new 4 track "elements²" ep with 21:13 minutes of varied sounds blending over from warm beats to grim melancholy.
