From space age to stone age and back. That's what human evolution is all about. And so is this new ep on no-response.org. Again a new fellow is taking seat in our home. k-jano comes from rostock our lovely baltic sea and brings his theory of evolution. He gives a lecture on the audile part of it and builds the perfect soundtrack with the evolution ep. From spaceshuttles back to flintstones. Even in this 3 piece quality shortcut you can see most things. That what's not clearly given you can easily read between the lines.

Have fun and enjoy the first outcome of k-jano on no-response.
