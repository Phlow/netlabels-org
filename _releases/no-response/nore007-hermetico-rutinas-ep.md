The as slowest known netlabel on the world is back on track again with a small release. The one or the other might have wondered, "Hey! WhatÂ´s the matter with the guys from no-response.org?" Well...not much! :-P We were simply too lazy. Now since the summer is definately over and the days are much colder, we are forced to spent more time again in the digital world. We are opening the new release season with "Hermetico - rutinas". nore007 brings us grim, minimalistic beats into our warm snuggery, with a soft touch of melancholy. Long live the Internet, enjoy this 4 tracker release.
