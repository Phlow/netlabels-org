December 4th, 2004, Carl Martin crossed the border (much against the will of the evil that is canadian customs) to open the night at the Ã” Patro Vys in montreal. Transient set the mood of the night with this set featuring tracks from his One and Camomille releases, as well as upcoming tracks on tbtmo. Here is the tracklisting

1. electronic data (from 'over the river and through the woods lp' on one.)
2. pastlyfe (from 'endless towers ep' on camomille.)
3. magic genie (from 'humid genie ep' on camomille.)
4. sweater weather (from 'pyrite 2cdr' on tbtmo.)
5. downhill gravity spirls (from 'white blazes lp' on noisyvagabond.)
6. ts-module04_ace(vst).it (from 'the impulse tracker ep' upcoming split cd on tbtmo.)
7. ts-module07_lake(vst).it (from 'the impulse tracker ep' upcoming split cd on tbtmo.)
8. ts-module01_fin(vst).it (from 'the impulse tracker ep' upcoming split cd on tbtmo.)
9. cute people &amp; god (from 'future jazz played underwater' on noisyvagabond.)
10. tymewerm (from 'vibon 2' cd compilation on tbtmo.)
11. visi (from 'vibon' cd compilation on tbtmo.)
12. ts-module08_treelightingceremonyfromadistance(vst).it (from 'the impulse tracker ep' upcoming split cd on tbtmo.com)

A great night of music ( transient was followed by the Khonnor+Ilkae duo Rodomontade and by David Kristian ) was offset by Transient's chilly idm set. Check out Apegenine Recording's website for pictures of the show
