Here's a new ep from Romanian multi-talented artist Selfmademusic. This 4 track ep is an exploratory ride into different shades of aural and visual story-telling; a comic book provides us with perfect company to the noirish feel of his music. Just like his comic book, the music transports you to familiar yet slightly altered places; environments stitched with dark ambiences and suspensefull moments are overseen by delicate yet macabre violins, guitars and pianos, with glitch and retrigger creating waves of distortioned beatwork. Great debute ep !
