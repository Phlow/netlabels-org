First single for camomille home player Kaneel. He brings us and makes us discover the ultimate sweetness in his sound. Manipulted ambiances, glitchy melodies and dirty distorted beated mayhem makes, paradoxically, one of the cutest and na√Øve tracks on camomille.

my ambient journey, short, versatile. this is my little secret world i wanna keep for myself.- Kaneel
