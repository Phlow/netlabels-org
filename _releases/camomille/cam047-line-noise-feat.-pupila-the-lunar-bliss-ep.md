- Florida, USA's Line Noise from the Lacedmilk Collective ( who released one track on www.tundramusic.com 's Magnetic Landscape V/A) , releases ''Lunarbliss EP'' a GRAND ep of over 35 mintues of pure idm beatwork, enchanting noise ambiances, beautiful jazzy vocals and lighter than air melodies that flow and progress thru out every part of the EP just like blood in our veins. The Ep also features the work of native-Afro-Brazilian chantsvocalist Pupila. Thank you Lacedmilk !
