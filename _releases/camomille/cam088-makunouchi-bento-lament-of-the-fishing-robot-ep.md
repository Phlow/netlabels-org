Great artists and friends Makunouchi Bento (ogredung, miasmah, one, kikapu) are back at camomille with what we think is their best work to date. Lament of the fishing robot ep is motion and color captured and translated into sound. It is immersing in its great musical and emotional depth and in its force of character. These 10 minutes of music serve greatly to prove our point, Makunouchi Bento are left unscathed by current trends and continue to do what they do best, all the while evolving into different entities as time goes by. On this ep they explore more cinematic themes; as you listen to the ep, you feel like you're following a script of tones and waves. A somewhat liquid combat between winter-time coldness and atmospheres filled of akward beauty.This ep serves as the conceptual follow up to their release on arhiva7 and contains beautiful art by Santiago Morilla (cover) and Andrei Dorokhin (bonus art). A wonderfull release by our romanian friends, Makunouchi Bento.
