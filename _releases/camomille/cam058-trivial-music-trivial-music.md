Upon hearing the first few seconds of trivial music's debute album, one could easily have anticipated that we would've been charmed by it. Composed of Tesia Alexandra and Aaron Rutledge (Also known as monotonik releaser and merck machine drum remixer Pliant, who also owned idm label Systorm), New york based trivial music brings us 40 minutes worth of freshly squeezed bleepy grooves superglued with 8bit-reminiscant vocal electropop, all with its fair share of sincere naiveness, urban compatibility and lush sounds. Complete.
