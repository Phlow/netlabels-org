&#92;Slashs first of many contribution to the camomille project is a dark and broken beated module did with masterfull technique. This module marks the sound of \slash at its beginning, chippy, sometimes plaid-esque, sometimes insane, idm/electronic/hip-hop sound weve known and loved since this release ! module to mp3 conversion made by Mcbain222 on soulseek !
