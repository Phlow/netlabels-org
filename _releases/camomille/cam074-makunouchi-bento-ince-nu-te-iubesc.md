Finally, fellow netaudio scene friends Makunouchi Bento ( ogredung , one, enoughrecords, apegenine recordings, miasmah, eerik inpuj sound, kikapu and some others ) have a track for us camomille folks. The romanian duo give us almost 10 minutes of sublime, noisy ambiences. This track is part of a project organised by well-known swedish curator Johanna Billing and was first played october 6th at H.arta Gallery from Timisoara (Romania). It remixes Rocky Erickson's '' You don't love me yet '' the makunouchi bento way. Using only the track with no added synthesis or instruments, they bring us a reconstruction of the original in splendid, supernatural scope. A great example of the guys' masterfull technique as they operated on the track like surgeons, recreating a new entity, with its own identity. Echoes
