We welcome Matthew Centonze back to camomille with his new blisaed ep ! Between juggling his newfound work producing rap and r&amp;b beats as C-ton and working on his album for apegenine, Blisaed finds the time to deliver 2 tracks of sincere beauty to us. For those of you who use to love his earlier blisaed and echion days, this is perfect. Inspiring melodies, lush soundscapes and pads, piano and his trademark emotronica sound. Springtime bliss.
