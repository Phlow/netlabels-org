- 8 releases ago, he released the breathtaking implosion ep, today he releases the single track ''empty'' . As we know him to do, he creates a soundscape unlike anything you've ever heard before. Glitchy endless sinefields and static-noise ambiances prep up what seems to be a lightspeed trip into the unkown. Quite the fucked up track from a great mood manipulator !
