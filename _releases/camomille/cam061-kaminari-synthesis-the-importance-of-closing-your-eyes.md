More than a year went by since he last released on camomille, but Camomille owner Vincent Fug√®re is back, this time as Kaminari Synthesis, releasing 35 minutes of soothing idm/indie rock vibes to ya'll. The ep starts where his kikapu release left off, exploring introspection, flight, nature, life and death with grandiose pad+guitar melodrama and idm beats wrapped in a glitchy, naive physiology.
