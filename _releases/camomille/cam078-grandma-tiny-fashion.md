Connor Kirby Long releases his first netlabel ep since the release of his highly acclaimed and super popular LP at Type Records as Khonnor. While still being a teen, his netlabel releases are regarded as ' classics ' ( mono, please do something ), invoking a great fanbase online. This time, on Tiny Fashioin, he follows his traditional 4 track mini-ep structure filled with folktronic manipulation, angsty vocals, noisy pads and glitchy beats that form an eclectic mix of static bliss and soulfull writing which warms the heart and soothes the mind.
