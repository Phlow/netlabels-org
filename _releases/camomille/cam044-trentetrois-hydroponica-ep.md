Montreal electronics for ya'll at #44. Creating since the age of 16 on 8 bit atari systems on which he coded his own tracker, 33, now 33 years old, strives to produce ambiant megatracks like the ones he releases on camomille. The first is EP titletrack, Hydroponica, a mechanical, multilayered ambiant track, and the second, an ethnoinspired tripbient progressiscape track called Dynavision. Interesting and original stuff. Great !
