Camomille's own Xerxes is back at camo with a refreshing 3 track ep + 2 bonus tracks. Footsteps EP counts 3 highly enjoyable trip-hop/ electrohip-hop grooves now known throughout the scene as ''xerxes style''. He's been dominating scene.org in download count, playing all the time on di.fm's chillout radio (1500 listeners) and all around taking over the world (well, we hope he will ). Now this is another classic release to add to his list, with enchanting melodies, bouncy love-making beats all add up to an epic release. Also on this release, we wanted to offer you a xerxes treat, so we release two bonus tracks ( with no releation to the ep) ; B1 is a remix of upcoming release and member mfyrek's awesome fly away from this place track and B2 is a housy, funky ElectroDub track. Enjoy !
