We're very delighted and excited over at camomille to release netaudio superstar Transient's Humid Genie EP, a very special twist on his marvelleous style. Known for his very dynamic, yet enchanting releases on netlabels monotonik, ogredung, skylab and kikapu ( to name a few), this time Carl Martin bends his musical talent and comes up with 2 tracks with undeniable strenght of character and sincerity. Progressive and calm, these tracks explore with great certainty the melding of bouncy hip-hop beats with ambient and idm. Swelling of organic beauty and complex beatwork, this ep is a perfect soundtrack to cold winter nights, introspective burrowing or observing landscapes.
