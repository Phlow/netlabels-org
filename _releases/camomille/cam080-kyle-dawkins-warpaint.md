We present to you a perfect soundtrack to spring days with Kyle Dawkins' superb Warpaint ep. Hailing from Georgia, USA, he melds his classical guitar studies, the banjo and his new experimentations into electronic sounds to create this magnificient 13 minutes of what could be described as avant-folk mixed with contemporary-classical and rock. The result is a distinct expression into eclectic, abstract scapes, beautiful sound design and intense acoustic soulfullness. A prequel to his full length release on Solponticello Records.
