Following up on his Matricaria Chamomilla kaneelremix, our italian friend !((0rkza1 comes back to camomille, but this time, with a full LP of noisy experimentations. Karaoke.Midiclash is 45 minutes of fusioned jazz and noise scattered throughout 11 tracks of organised sonic mayhem. Exploring without the confines of pop melodies, !((0rkza1 delivers us an intensive collection of abstract beats, glitchy scapes and stressfull moments. New meaning to hecticism ?
