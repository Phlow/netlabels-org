Hailing from Lyon, France, nil follows up from his track on our featherfoil compilation with his very first solo release ' Le mini mini ep '. 3 tracks of very uplifting melodies blended with some upbeat glitch and idm/drill&amp;bass techniques. Masterfully created beatwork and sequencing, eclectic style and ingenious instrumental crafting makes this release an adequate sonic wallpaper of nil's individuality and creativity.
