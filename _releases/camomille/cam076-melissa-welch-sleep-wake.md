We're opening to 2005 in a grand way, putting out the first ever release by 16 year old Californian Melissa Welch. We are honored to showcase her beautiful yet tiny ep 'sleep-wake'; 3 tracks of eclectic bliss, filled with layers upon layers of sweetness and soul-warming vibes, all wrapped up in esotheric, candycane vocals. Absolutely a taste of what's to come from Melissa, who, to our eyes, has a dreamy sound with a future in music as solid as concrete.
