We release yet another mini-ep from another first-time releaser, Wouter Van Veldhoven, a biology student from Utrecth, Netherlands. This is a wonderfull ep that shows much character; the melody flows from movement to movement, letting sometimes slide some swirling noise or found sound textures from Wouter's window. A great experimentation in themes and concept, aided by well-built soundforms and well-realised composition. Somewhere between post-modern, idm and pop.
