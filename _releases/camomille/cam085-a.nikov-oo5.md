Aleksander Nikov, from Skopje, Macedonia, has crafted a beautiful ep : ' oo5 ' takes place somewhere between the static complexity of our lives and our simple, serene surroundings. In its 4 tracks ( and 1 remix ), he efficiently created strates of atmospheres that leave a sense of space, of freedom. This is his first ever music release and we are proud at camomille to be able to present these engaging and personal tracks.
