March 23rd '06, in Timisaora, Romania, our great friends Makunouchi Bento performed a set part of TMBase workshop. Felix Petrescu (sampler+mixer) and Valentin Toma (laptop) supplied 50 minutes of their best works and a few unreleased tracks at Club30 and were nice enough to let us debute our mix catalogue with theirs.
