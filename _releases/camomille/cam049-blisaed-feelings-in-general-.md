Ex-member blisaed, who's been pretty busy these past few months with 2 eps on ronin collective and one on monotonik, blesses us with this 5 track EP entitled ''Feelings In General''. This time, blisaed explores his more ambiant, minimal side all the while retaining his illustreous and grand cinematic feel. Downtempo, glitchy hip-hop and swave melodies blisaed style, and only he knows how to create these wonderfull moodmakin' sweet vibes.
