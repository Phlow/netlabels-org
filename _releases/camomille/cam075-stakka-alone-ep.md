On Xmas day, we release the first ever musical release by polish musician Stakka. Serendipity, maybe, that, these tracks seem to soundtrack snowfall and wintery landscapes. 6 tracks that total up to a bit more than 20 minutes of dreamy hip-hop vibes directly from the cumulous clouds. Crunchy beats with melodies that light the winter nightsky. Merry christmas to all !
