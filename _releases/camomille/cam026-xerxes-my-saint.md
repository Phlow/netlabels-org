inspired by the girl who will save me from the living dead says xerxes. One has to think this girl is lucky, especially when blessed by a low down groovy funky hip-hop track like this one. This track has all the credentials to appeal to any mood and to change the shape of things to come, but we at camomille prefer to see it as this : the perfect love-makin track weve ever heard.
