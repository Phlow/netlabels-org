Enter Dirty cluster, our first split ep from Bulgaria's Sektor ( tonatom) and Russia's I.l.i. ( enough records, tonatom ). Nearly 20 minutes of sweet and sour idm, with its fair share of dreamy melodies, akward moods and creeping beats. Sharing evenly the ep between its 4 tracks, Sektor and I.l.i. provide a dance of fire and ice as they exchange melodies. From gazeous clouds to solid manufacturing of beats.
