Before Matt Centonze came to be known as echion or blisaed, he had the mantle of mistrial. His first track for camomille is a grand one, Symphony of Sorrow,  A SOS for your heart as the author says, and it is true ; this track acts as a refuge, a safe haven and is the beginning of the end for mistrial, but the start of a wonderfully colored trip into music for Matt Centonze.
