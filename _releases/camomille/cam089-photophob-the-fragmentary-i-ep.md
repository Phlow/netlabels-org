Here comes 2006 and with it, a new release by Photophob (tonatom, binkcrsh), known for his release on the sucessfull american label Hive records and for co-founding the netlabel laridae. The Fragmentary I ep brings idm back to camomille the way we like it, dynamic, evolving and ecclectic. Herwig weaves a perfect balance between rhythm and ambience and creates waves of intertwining melodies that make us feel at home in its warmth, yet alienates us in its coldness. A constant struggle between tones that is both beautiful and gritty, both peaceful and violent. Here's to prove that IDM is not dead and still going strong and that some artists do break the mold !
