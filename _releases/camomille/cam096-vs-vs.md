What a special release for the holidays ! We present to you Paris, France's VS, a group of 5 dedicated to rediscovering guitars and alternative rock while delving into many elements of experimentation. A strangely appealing crossbreading of trip-hop, post-rock and some hints and bursts of nu-metal and progressive rock, VS creates impressive moments; frozen in a subtle, delicate environment, you travel within VS' darker fissures, hovering over the singer's evocating lyrics and through pulsating, progressing elevations to a nostalgic, dramatic climax. VS create their own world, applying visual aesthetic to their music's structure, pushing way beyond the confines of alternative rock thanks to their inventive composing and energizing interpretations.
