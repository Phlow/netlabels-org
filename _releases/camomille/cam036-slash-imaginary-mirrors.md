fake feelings, distorted memories, coloured perceptions. even your reflection in the mirror is just a trick of the light - \Slash (Surasshu). The closest anyone will ever come to the electronica equivalent to a slow ballad has been attained by Steven Velema, who brings his natural twist of things to the table yet again, this time twisting traditional 80rockpop and chipping it up. Sweet sweet sweetness.
