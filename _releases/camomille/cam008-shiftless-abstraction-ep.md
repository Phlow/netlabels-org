An abstract collection of tracks made in one day. Many surpising and different sounds and effects for using just a tracker. I find the tracks to have a distant sound and an emotional feel. A very powerful twenty minutes that should only be played in Impulse Tracker for maximum effect. Love and death go together. Some of the tracks have a mourning kind of sense to them and the tracks themselves battle with themselves as the final half sounds contradicts the first half! All in all, I enjoyed myself making these songs because they are always something I wanted to hear.
