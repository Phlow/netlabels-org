Following up a beautiful ep with vocalist Pupila on camomille #47, Florida's Line noise from the Lacedmilk Technologies crew comes back to camomille, this time doin' it solo. He presents us 3 uplifiting tracks of calm, progressive travels in chilled out techno. Drifting somewhere between oldskool, house and downtempo, these 27 minutes of beat-intensive, pad enlightened, guitar grooved are a great addition to the camomille project + perfect moodenhancing music for hot summer days!
