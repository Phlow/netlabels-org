We are very happy to announce a new ep from our favorite duo, Tang Kai ! They are back at camomille after taking some time to work on their upcoming album for apegenine recordings. Here they present 4 tracks of delicate and gentle sounds we've come to appreciate from mikael fyrek ( who's released a couple of great eps recently on Kahvi ) and jenny tang kai. Subtle, intricate beatwork breathes through jenny's superbly efficient and soulfull vocals. Aural, organic and cinematic, Tang Kai's Evangelion is not only a testament to quality netlabel music, but an experience that leaves an impression of purity and makes a mind fully fertile to imaginative and thoughtfull enlightenements.
