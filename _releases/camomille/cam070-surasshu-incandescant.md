While camomille takes a break to redesign the whole site, we release a special single release from home member Surasshu to announce and represent his newly-released CD album at Apegenine. Idm like only Steven Velema can do, subversive, crawling and dark, his own style that we saw him put into action here at camomille many times. Melding hip-hop, electro and early 90s videogame music, Surasshu yet again provides some experimentation in clicks and breaks, while keeping his trademark synthesized, plasticwrapped sound we've known him for. If you like surasshu and wish to support him, follow the links below to buy his album.
