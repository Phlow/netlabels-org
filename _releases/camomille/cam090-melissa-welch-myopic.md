Already a netlabel favorite, Melissa Welch is back at camomille with her second release, an 18 minute track that dwelves into many movements; dynamics are well-explored here as Melissa takes you through a multitude of tones and environments as the sound waves build paintings of childish constructions and deep, cavernous tunnels. Maintaining all throughout this ep an ambiguous sound, always twisting and turning between cute/nostalgic and happy/dark, Melissa Welch keeps reminding us how organic and personal her sound is with this ep filled with layered beauty, hip-hop and idm beatwork, original synthesis and inspiring vocals.
