Having not officially released music since the mid-90s, legendary modgroup Fairlight's Mikael Fyrek makes a comeback in the netscene , teaming up with awe-inspiring vocalist Jenny Tang Kai as the ambient/electro duo simply named Tang Kai. They offer us 4 tracks of sublime electrified trip-hop, with slowpaced, cinematic progression, accompanied with elevating vocals and soulful writing. An ep to enjoy while they finish their album for Apegenine Recordings, due winter 2005. Peaceful, yet creeping and crawling beats, that soothes the mind
