Xerxes, the norwegian scene legend is back and ''blesses'' us with a 3-track EP ; Presets contains the title track ''presets'' reminiscent of his classic hip-hop funky nostalgia tracks from back in da day, blessed, a calm almost esotheric trip-hoppy, hip-hoppy electronica track and The day we met, a beatless ambiance of beautiful harmonies and great finale for the ep, which is, without a doubt, one of the most beautiful releases on camomille.
