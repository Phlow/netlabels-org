We introduce you WhiteNoise label owner Caelum and his first ep on camomille This guitar ep. Textural guitar playing, dark and nostalgic ambiences, crisp sound design and an overlaying feeling of mysticism fill this album and make it a complete study into Caelum's style. Another proof of quality from the emerging swedish scene. Perfect for spring time panorama's beautiful grey, rainy days.
