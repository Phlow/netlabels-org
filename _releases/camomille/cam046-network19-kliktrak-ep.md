We're psyched about this release ! Mark Spurgeon, known as Network19, releases his kliktrak EP, an immensily beautiful minimal house collection filled with progressive noisy scapes and calm, serene amabiances and beatwork. This is the first netlabel release for network19, and we're honored to be distributing this high quality production to the masses!
