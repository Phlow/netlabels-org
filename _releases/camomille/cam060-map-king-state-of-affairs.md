Apart from owning and operating Contexterrior records and Textone netlabel and releasing minimal house as Starch Boy, German-born Bj√∂rn Hartmann also takes the time to compose beautiful idm-influenced pieces as Map King. His debute release with this moniker, he contributes to camomille 6 amazing short tracks of trippy electronica/idm. Urban travel music, B. brings beautiful stylism to the ep, with long, phat synthsweeps, to noisy ambiances and precisely aimed idm beats. Soundtrack work to the love story of a concrete jungle, with a dark twist.
