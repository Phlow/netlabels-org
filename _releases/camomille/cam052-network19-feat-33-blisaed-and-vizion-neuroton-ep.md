Remixes of the great neuroton track found on camomille #46's Kliktrak EP. 33 starts off the EP with a very organic, fx-filled more ambient take on the track, with many layers of soundmanipulation. Next up is Blisaed's mix, overwhelming with monster beat phatness, vibed up with idm supertextures like we know him to construct. Last is vizion's mix, the more poppish version of the EP ; bouncy but progressive beatwork + slow paced almost dubby grooves. All remixes have a disctinctive flow of their own, but all pay hommage to net19''s original noisy, crunchy ambient Neuroton!
