Perfect timing for the release of our pal Transient's ep Endless Towers. The end of summer, just as this ep, adequately releaves us of the intense heat and drifts into cool, yet somewhat eclectic times. Having released recently two great eps on miasmah and some other great tracks on his own netlabel noisy vagabond + monotonik, ogredung, kikapu and observatory online, Transient delivers us 32 minutes of music that makes us feel his reach into his many different styles, which all, in a beautiful contradiction, have the trademark '' transient sound ''. From housy tracks to natural almost organic ambiances to very very fresh trip-hop, transient's addition to the camomille releases is as unpredictable as september; rain, heat, sun and cold all in one.
