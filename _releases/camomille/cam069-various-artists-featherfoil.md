A few months in the making, in the spirit of Matricaria Chamomilla and to thank the artists and the supporters involved in the project, Camomille releases Featherfoil (an ancient name for camomille flowers, believed to be a flower of the sun), a massive 1hour52 minutes of sweetness, beats and pads as only these people can provide. Includes familiar names such as map king, mikael fyrek ( one half of tang kai ), transient[noisyvagavond, ogredung], line noise[laced milk]and others; camomille members vizion, xerxes, surasshu and the return of kaneel as well as some new, fresh faces to the camo crew like nil, the open directory project, epoq[hellven, autoplate, mono], valisproject [hellven and ronincollective's RS3], sense [one, neo-ouija, mono] and more ! A very adequate painting of what was, is and will be camomille.
