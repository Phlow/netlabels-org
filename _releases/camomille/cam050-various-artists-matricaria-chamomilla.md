To commemorate our benchmark release #50, Camomille brings together a few of the artists who helped us become what we are and helped to finetune what Camomille sounds like and what it stands for. [But it's mostly an excuse to do a Camomille artist compilation.]

The compilation kicks off with Nightech's mechanical idm, followed by 33's illmatik organic spacism, Network19's electrodub roller, Hapbt's progressive housy breaks, an electribal superscape by Blisaed, !((0rkza1's noisy Kaneel makeover, Vizion's glitchy drill&amp;basses radiohead remix, Surasshu's plastic ghettosynthetic dnb, Shiftless's ambient emoscape, Benefit Of The Boomerang's cinematic orchestra and finishes off with Spyefex's very beautiful classical/electrosynth love song.
