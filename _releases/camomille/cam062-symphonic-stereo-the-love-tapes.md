We're psyched over at camomille to release a 3 track ep from Symphonic Stereo, an american duo famed for their awesome appearances on the indietronica compilations Starvingbuthappier and lovetara + exquisite releases for Nishi and Please Do Something. This time Shaun and Andrea bring us their trademark indietronica pop vocals but with a heavier, more dubby approach, while keeping the sweetness in their sound. 3 tracks that grab you and keep you in their clutches for many repeated listens.
