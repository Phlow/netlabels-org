We're happy to release an ep by London's Cheju, a prolific artist from Boltfish fame who also released on many a netlabel ( kahvi, filament recordings, lacedmilk ). Despite all resolutions is an uplifting blend of good old idm; waves of distorted synthesis immerse you completely while you are gently rocked by spacey pads and pushed upwards by the crunchy beatwork. IDM is still alive !
