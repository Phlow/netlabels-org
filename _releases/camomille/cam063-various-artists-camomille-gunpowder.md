A few months ago, the Numia website hosted their first Netlabel Battle in which a netlabel chooses two musicians to represent them and let the people vote for their favorite tune. Good friends Makunouchi Bento won the competition, but our entrants, kaneel and surasshu, placed 2nd and fourth in their respective voting groups. Kaneel brought his usual angstfilled, glitch powered beauty, and surasshu made an amazing and dark dnb/plaidish roller. + Kaneel's entry was chosen to be featured on the battle's official 12'' vinyl release[feat. makunouchi bento, sawe and vim !].
