Leenak (kaneel) and Makunouchi Bento have once again put their minds together and created 'Errata', under their Miopedi collaboration. Often split releases come across with a fitting split persona, though Miopedi : Errata has strong personalities reminiscent of the ambience and sound that seemingly existed in memory long before you heard them.

As surreal and haunting as the accompanied artwork, it's tempting to hunt down the relation and reason behind this caustic ambience.. only no deduction could bring it justice. This is the very essence of the Miopedi project that got us asking for more. Familiar and mysterious at the same time -- while retaining the desire of enjoyable and repeated listening.
