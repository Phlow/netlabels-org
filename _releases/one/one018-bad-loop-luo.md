This flourishing shuffled step and melodic craftsman from Finland proves his commitment to taking his style to new heights and quality with Luo. An achievement inviting you to quietly listen and enjoy a comfortable and catchy groove with its adventurous instrumental adornment, thoughtful melodies, spiraling synths, playful/pragmatic percussion, and bouncing bass. bad loop's intent to create a solidly cohesive listen from begining to end has paid off.

It's nearly been three years since his last acclaimed netreleases through Kahvi, easily making this one of the most anticipated releases by our staff and others already familiar with his music.
