Revealing the somber underpinnings of his Loscil recordings, Scott Morgan has given us Stases - A collection of drones based upon the backgrounds of his work for Kranky Records, from 2001 to now.

As with his previous output, Stases follows theme and concept with further reference and meaning given through the title's definition: "..a condition of balance among various forces; motionlessness". Textured, aqueous, warm and pleasingly rich in (often bright) tonality giving us a deeper focus and alternate view into the corners of Morgan's music. Seemingly so surrounding, submersive, and natural - that it becomes easy to forget the complex overtones and flowing mixtures involved in the creation of them.
