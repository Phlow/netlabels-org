For this first release it was set to unite some of the best musicians we know in different genres. Gathered here, they smoothly mind the gap between their respective styles; idm, guitar, one channel, low-fi, ambient, techno, etc., What better way to represent One and protest the shortsighted slant that 'genres' create, than to join it all under one roof?

With contributions from Makunouchi Bento, Lackluster, Ronny Pries, randomajestiq, relative q, colophon, plosive, Sense, _KhlEr3L, pinkj, and Whitenoiz -- You'd be hard pressed to find such a diverse album with this level of talent anywhere on the store shelves.
