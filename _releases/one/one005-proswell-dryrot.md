A 45 minute continuous mix from Proswell, ft. b-sides, out takes, new material, and a few favorites from his sophomore release Carrot Dossier (columbo theme, tar and atari, rat news) on m3rck records. Even with this relation, Dryrot is easily a release with its own identity. 

Finding time between releases at m3rck and running Inpuj, he explores the laid back and driving sound that's heard between the cracks of Carrot Dossier and often strays from the sound that defined that album (as is heard within the opening minutes). While a welcome and surprise release from one of our favorites, the unique sensibility and style of this release also makes an exceptional introduction to those that have yet to hear his music and will most likely leave them searching for more.
