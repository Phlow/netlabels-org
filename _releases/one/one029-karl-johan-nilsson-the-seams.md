Breaking a six-month silence for us is Karlâ€“Johan Nilsson's The Seams. A work featuring wide, sweeping strokes from minimal brushes that add up to a thick canvas of sound - electrical static scratches and crawls, rolling waves of rhythm, bass, guitar, synths and ambiance come from all sides. Sounds seemingly trying to escape while a song progresses or takes form. 

The Seams' end results are not entirely focused on the minimalist focus or common click-gut-glitch manners, but rather a sublime and epic manner full of moody curiousities, melody and melodrama built from the intricacies these styles bring and their combinations to a larger scale. Accompanied by hi-res cd artwork and a gallery by Adrian Leverkuhn.
