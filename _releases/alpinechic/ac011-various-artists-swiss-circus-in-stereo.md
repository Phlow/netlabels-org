One year after first appearing on the netlabel scene, Alpinechic proudly presents its second compilation of swiss electronic underground music. And this time there is enough to please every listener: with 13 excellent tracks by upcoming as well as established artists it gives a beautiful overview of our alpine music panorama.

From fast and frenzy electrofunk to laidback atmospheres, back to clicks and cuts or just simple electropop. The compilation states how alive and well the swiss electronic scene is in the year 2005 and also reflects our multicultural country with artists from all over the place.
