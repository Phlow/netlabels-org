Alpinechic presents Freiraum's second stunning EP "Zexy" - a change in direction, compared to their "E-22" EP released last summer. If "E-22" left you shaking on the dancefloor, "Zexy" will give at first a rush of sounds and then a durable experience of high-class electronica. A step forward for our two friends from Zurich, showing us a great potential and a musical growth. The 4-tracks (apparently selected from 50 new tracks!) vary from breakbeat, disco and psychedelic lounge and are as fresh as spring and carefully produced in the detail. This is an amazing release that will leave you wordless, like us now... so let the music speak!
