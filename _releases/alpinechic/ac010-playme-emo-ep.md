After about 10 months from its launch AlpineChic is particularly proud to announce the 10th release: Emo Ep is a sensational electronic mini album delivered by Playme, the ZÃ¼rich sexiest electronic trio ever.

Emo Ep features 5 emotional and sensitive emocore tracks and it will guide you through the creative and eccentric Playme galaxy. If you are into retro video games sounds, sexy female vocals, 80s-esque electro beats and pop music with a punk attitude, you are visiting the right page :-)
