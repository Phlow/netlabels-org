After 6 months from his first ep release, Le Zero delivers an other magnificent and eclectic mini album to AlpineChic. Asleep Ep is a very versatile sound experience that shows all the production qualities of the very talented songwriter Amin Khatir aka Le Zero.

A sequence of 4 tracks that will take you into a short journey from electro-trash-punk situations to sweet pop harmonies to perverse vocoder voices to easy listening atmospheres. High class electronic music that never get boring and that also features an excellent vocal performance by LeutOhm on the title track 'Asleep'.
