Freiraum's release for AlpineChic is a full throttle breakbeat electronica 6-song ep. The Zurich duo present overdriven synthi sounds combined with danceable beats and pumping basslines in a mix that make this a fresh release for your summer groove. The 6-songs are a well balanced mix from electro to big beat reminding of its most powerful releases to indian atmospheres and vocal interludes with uptempo breakbeats and all this without falling into clich√©s or losing its feet moving power.
