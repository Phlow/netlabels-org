Summer is just to come and one bit wonder gives you the soundtrack for the first bbqs in these days. Warm and deep music for chilled beer and a relaxed atmosphere. Starting with the groovy Orange International, the second track will take you Far Away to the calm interstellar paradise to enjoy the beautiful view on the relaxed Sunrise. Wow, what a sound! Now back to the beat, Kiorda offers a Real Deal to you. Just engage with it and you won't regret. What a trip! When you look back you just will realize: I Miss You!
