With this EP, Mirsch a.k.a. Kultobjekt once again proves himself as 1bit wonder's probably most productive artist: Six new tracks right out of the fridge, cool and refreshing. No cheap fast food, but exquisite delicatessen. Tasty fare between minimal and dub. For ears, body and... tongue? Whatever you like - have fun!
