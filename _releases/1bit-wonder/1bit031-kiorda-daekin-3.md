Kiorda keeps his personal tradition of coming up with surprising new stuff on each release he does for us. This time he makes you dive deep into ambient: Glitchy sounds and melodies of engrossed elegance create a haunting yet still wonderfully relaxing atmosphere. With each minute passing, "3" becomes an even more massive trip inwards, sucking you in for its whole run time of about half an hour.
