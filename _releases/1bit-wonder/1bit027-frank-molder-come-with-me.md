With 1bit 027, Frank steps up for another beautiful ambient release: Melodies and bass lines in perfect harmony, backed up by soft broken beats. Being a big fan of Juno6, Frank took his "Inside the Blue" and gave it the unique Molder handwriting while the title track "Come With Me" shows us another, previously undisplayed side of himself: Forward striving and full of energy. This album impressively shows Frank's producing abilities and his development as an artist. We say: Chapeau!
