How Glander became part of our family is one more of those wonderful stories how music can connect people: As we approached him for a release on our label, he had already been working on tracks for us. After his highly acclaimed debut on our last compilation, Glander delivers six more tracks for 1bit 0266. Melodies and sounds in constant transaction, chords echoing into deep space, all carried by solid bass lines. And to put the icing on the cake, Daniel Stefanik - dub brother in mind - returns to netaudio with one of his inimitable reshapes, developing "Zavial" into a real epic.
