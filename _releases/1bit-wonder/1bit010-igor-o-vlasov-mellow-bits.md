Due to a flood of releases on different netlabels within the last few months, Igor has already been called "the John Tejada of netaudio" as his immense productiveness covers all styles of house and techno as well as dubby and experimental stuff.

After the great success of Sven Tasnadis 1bit 009 we chose to go for another 4/4-release while making sure to stay somewhat compatible to couch listening culture. So we selected some of Igor's deeper tracks for 1bit #10 - the "Mellow Bits". Enjoy!
