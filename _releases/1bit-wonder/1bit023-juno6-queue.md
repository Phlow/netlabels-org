During the last months, Juno6 has been one of the most active producers in our artist roster - and still every production out of his hands is a quality of its own. A wonderfully warm sound has become his trademark and can be seen as rare exception amongst digitally dominated netaudio scene. Very proudly we present this collection of six incredibly deep and melancholic downbeat tracks.
