After two compilation contributions, Nico finally delivers a whole new EP. Many people have been waiting for it - when we were talking to listeners of 1bit, we heard quite often that Nicorolas 1bit #003 is their favourite. So here he is, our guy from Berlin with his unique blend of broken beats and lovely digital synths. And again, we are stunned by the maximum of funkyness he squeezes into his tracks with such a minimal sound setup.
