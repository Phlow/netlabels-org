"This is probably the most personal release on 1bit so far. It's about love. It's about hatred. It's about life. It's about sheer desperation, unbridled wrath and paralyzing agony. Its title could have been 'Love, Despair and Hope' as well ÃÂÃÂ but Sven already named his release like this. Some of you might dance to it, some might just listen - whatever you do, I hope you feel it a bit..."
