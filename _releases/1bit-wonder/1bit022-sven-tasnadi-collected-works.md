It has been almost a year since you have heard something from Sven. This pretty massive collection of works, ranging from ambient to dancefloor techno, is one of the reasons why it took so long for his new release. Contributions are made by fellow 1bit-wonderians Juno6 (with one of his typical mellow techno tracks) and lately renamed Steffen Bennemann (delivering his most dancefloor-oriented production to date).
