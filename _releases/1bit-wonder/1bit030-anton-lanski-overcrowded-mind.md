New year, new faces: Following the steps of Igor O. Vlasov, Anton Lanski is our second recruitment from Russia. He debuts with an EP rich of flawless tech house - harmonic melody layers surrounded by tasty rythms. Driving and relaxing at the same time - a perfect match with the sound of 1bit, foreshadowing feelings of spring in the midst of cold winter nights.
