Since our start off, we have been looking for music that combines electronic with hand-made stuff. With Endlos, we finally found the perfect piece of the puzzle - just another amazing story of soul brothership written in our wonderful home city of Lipsia (Leipzig). This first Endlos EP is an excerpt of their 2004 album which was published as a very limited CD edition only. However, we think these songs are timeless: Enjoy seven epic pieces of deep electronica, fusing jazz with samplers, lo-fi drummachines embracing manipulated guitars and warm synths.
