Our favorite Canadian is back on 1bit: Happily, we present "Vapor Referral". Three new stunning pieces of glitchy digital deep tech - plus a remix by Steffen Bennemann for Le Cantin's "Granny" (original track appeared on 1bit 019). The perfect kind of stuff to close your eyes and dance to in early spring 2007.
