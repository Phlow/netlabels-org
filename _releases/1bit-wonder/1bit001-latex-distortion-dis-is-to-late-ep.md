The kick-off for 1bit wonder is given by our home-grown project Latex Distortion with their "Dis is to late E.P.". This first release already indicates where our future journey will lead us: Electronic music beyond all stylistic boundaries.  On 1bit wonder, we release what rocks us.  No matter whether is ambient, minimal techno or experimental.
