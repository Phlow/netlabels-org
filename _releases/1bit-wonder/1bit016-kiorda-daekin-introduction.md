About one year after his rather deephousy debut on 1bit 004, Kiorda strikes back with a piece of heavy electronica. Oscillating between icy sounds, sharp-cutted beats and mellow chords, Kiorda throws in all his production capabilities for this release. Five tracks that sound like excerpts taken from the perfect score for your favorite head movie... And let me guess - does it play in Scandinavia?
