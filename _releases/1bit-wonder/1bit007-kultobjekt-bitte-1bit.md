This is Mirsch of Latex Distortion with his solo debut: Kultobjekt represents his softer side, dedicated rather to warmup sessions and afterhours than to peaktime stomping. As he starts, you will come think 'This Must Be Morning' - wake up as The Coffee Brings You Back.

And when the day is gone and the sun is setting again, his sound is just perfect again when you're Getting Hot For Evening: Dancin' all night long till Next Morning Breaks. And after all that, Daniel Stefanik will tell you that for him it's just the coffee, too, that brings him back.
