After their first release on 1bit earned so many praises, we are happy to see another EP by Endlos on our netlabel. This time, Mario and Daniel have put together exclusive live versions of five tracks from their last CD "Kein Grund zufrieden zu sein": Slowly flowing epics, melancholic dialogues of machines and guitars. Live support comes from Johannes Russ (bass &amp; guitar) and Martin (sax).
