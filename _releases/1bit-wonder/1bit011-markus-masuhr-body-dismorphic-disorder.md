Markus' introduction to the world of bits is an EP with heavy moving breakbits, combining a reduced minimal sound setup with a composition style that is essentially pop. Not exactly the type of stuff you would want to hear on a christmas dinner with your parents - but 1bit has never been about kitsch anyway. So lean back and let Markus paint the ice flowers on your windows...
