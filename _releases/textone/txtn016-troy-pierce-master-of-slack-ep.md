bleepy churning rhythms from another recent berlin transplant. underneath a fresh gloss of catchy berlin production values, troy's formative period in the u.s. shines through with low res drum machine aesthetics and the restraint and hypnotic repetitivity of early midwest techno classics. a journey between pop and grit, managing to stay acessible without relinquishing the bizarre undertones that will keep you interested when the tracks loop on eternal repeat. more intercontinental projects like this and maybe the deutsch amerikanische freundschaft can be resurrected again after all.
