Our man of many styles and even more aliases strikes with another surprise: experimental dub-hop?! The first track, Underground, represents a truly mind-boggling reinterpretation of spoken words over music, miles ahead of the stale formulaic product served by most of the hip-hop industry today. Showing that unique production method matters more than fitting into preconceived genre pigeon holes, Haze travels a continuous arc from Underground via Miami Bass, an electro freestyle improvisation, to the trademark minimal glitch sounds characteristic of his Contexterrior releases. Lush Lover teems with a certain 1940s crooner's melancholy; My balls is a pared down journey into found-soundscapes; and New Shoes brings back that deep and dirty dub element so important to Jamaica and so painfully absent in 'Dub Techno.'
