  <description>as our first repeat offender on textone, jay haze brings you the em-effin' ruckus on his latest ep. no joke. minimal funk straight from the pressure cooker onto your plate and palate. a little spicey, but hey, that's good for you! 

the marathon track "super freak fried" delivers the soundtrack for your next kinky s&amp;m session with the neighbor (no use in denying, we've been watching you all along). if you just want to dance, that's ok, too. "africa" goes on a shopping trip at the organic corner store and brings back all kinds of moisty-fresh dub elements. "in the know" chooses a drier route of stripped minimal crackling, complete with ringing gunshot snares and assorted noisy hoopla. "acid pimp" completes the menu metronome-style with just a splash of analog bleeps for evening discombobulation. are you with us?
