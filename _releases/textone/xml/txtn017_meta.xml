  <description>matt john is a berliner. tasty. with a deadpan instinct for big soundsystem acoustics, matt develops his own brand of dry funk, with staggered staccatoes and arpeggios that transform the keyboard into a ballistic test range. cross-generational bump and grind with extensive sequencing arcs. non sequiturs galore that tickle and inspire.
