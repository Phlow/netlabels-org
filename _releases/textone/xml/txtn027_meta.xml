  <description>Fark loves ladies tennis.  This first ep from the Zurich due is a homage for those fine athletes and a bow to the lovely skirts they wear.  We heard rumors from our friends in Zurich about two producers whose mad skills on the drumcomputer and violent live shows were worth checking out.  After some investigation and a fist fight or two we got our hands on these fine tunes.  In exchange to the tunes we had to post bail to get the boys out of jail.  Our problem was that the masters were still at their studio.  Their problem was that they were facing murder charges.  To make a short story even shorter, we managed to get our hands on the music and the results are here.
Venus is a dark trip through the twilight zone.  Late at night when the court is free and the freaks are out.  Anna jacks like no other.  Stripped down and rolling on the ground funk at its best.  Patty is a little more heavy set but just as playful.  She builds her game into a frenzy and dishes out a killer end.  Last is Martina who is a bit deeper but just as adapt as our three other ladies.  A little twilight zone music to end a great EP.  We hope you enjoy these as much as we enjoyed them.</description>
