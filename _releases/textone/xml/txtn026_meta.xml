  <description>One clear spring day we received a CD in the mail with the following inscription:  "thought to send you some tracks that you might find interesting and maybe release them on textone."  24 minutes laster we had the next textone release ready to go.  This is not Lump's first release here and we are very pleased to be able to host another excellent 4 tracker from our man in Finland....or England...or wherever it is that Lump is at today.
The tracks are signature Lump sound with a bit more kick and club appeal.  To kick things off Matto provides the listener with atmospheric pads and driving groove.  Underneath it all we find all kinds of strange noises fighting for control of your ear.  Electric duck parade is, as the name suggest, quacky.  No surprise there really as the parade is viewed from the eyes of the snail-Lump.  This one is a bit more driving with a hypnotic melody which is nicely contrasted by little noises and sonic dirt.  2nd rate conflict is the dance floor stormer here. Relentless, driving and of course quirky.  The last track, kumina, was released as a cd bonus on a sub-static compilation, but Falko was kind enough to allow us to include this jam here.  Enjoy the loudness.</description>
