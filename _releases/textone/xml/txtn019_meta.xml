  <description>Textone's mid summer release is one of the most wide ranging releases in our arsenal. Heard about Berlin's club nights? They're all here. The peak time, the lack of air, the sweat, the after-hours, meeting new people, the return home, the chill out. 5 dance floor tracks to hit every possible element of the nightlife in the city that never sleeps. A soundtrack for coming out of the cold snowy winter into a blue sunny summer. Trading long dark hours for nights that barely last 6 hours. Run around like a headless chicken while your whole body is drippin' with sweat. Chill out at the click klak club and relax with your favorite lady. Get ready to rock.</description>
