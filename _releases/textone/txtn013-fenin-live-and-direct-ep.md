from berlin with love comes a rockin dub inspired piece of who-ya from the infamous lars fenin aka fenin (shitkatapult, meteo sound) . lars hails from the north of germany in a town that slightly resembles an overpacked wal-mart ! this is evident in his warm, funky ,chunky and sometimes dodgy riffs. this ep features 6 songs ranging from kick you in the ass poppy to warm mellowed out electro. all songs have the same common love and this is dub music.
