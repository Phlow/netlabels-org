Textone's first mini album happen for a simple reason.  We did not know which track to leave behind and being the anxious people that we are we decided to just release them all.  Leo's production resembles a kid who listens to the
street noises through a cup glued to the wall.  Full of textures yet not dreamy but rather jacking and thumping.  He drops little surprises around every bend in the sonic road.  Leo's play with vocals is the cherry on top of the pie: Voices that serve as another instrument in Leo's crafty hands with the kind of rhythm and position that is traditionally left to percussions.

It's a textone to launch a new style in production, a futuristic free jazz and post space age dance.
