With only subtle effects use but all-the-more-carefully crafted sounds, Theodor Zox takes us on a different kind of journey into Scandinavia as an architectural utopia constructed out of beautiful synth lines and high-frequency ornament. Very calm, but swinging and enviably optimistic.

The artist about his work:
"Being a very visual person, as well as having synasthetic experiences through my entire life, I perceive sound as form and colour. For me every sound is equally important so therefore every sound in a piece of music is sculpted and moulded to form its own original characteristics of tone and texture, I often use the terms form and plasticity in evaluation of my work.No samples or presets are used, all sounds are synthesized and designed from scratch."

"The temp.light EP was formed as an escape from my usual deep dub techno, it's deliberately produced very dry and light. I see it as a breath of fresh air and a beginning of a new direction for my future work. "

It should come as no surprise then, that Theodor submitted his own graphics for this release.
