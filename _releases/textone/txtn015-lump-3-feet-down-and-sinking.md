What's the Finnish winter like? This textone release by Lump will shed some light on this question and promises to kick your brain into new dimensions. The super low bass and the ultra high highs made us all wonder if Lump has no neighbors. Can he hear frequencies only animals can? Lump delivers solid minimal cuts. Atmospheres layered with nostalgia covered in nordic winds and deepness from which to keep children away. Hot grooves from a very very cold place. Warms our hearts to e able to pass these on to you.
And no, none of us can pronounce the track names.
