...pedestrian accidents are all but inevitable!

Textone veterans Ren√© Breitbarth, Kero and B. take over the steering wheel here with their trademark sounds; in shotgun we've got a crew of upcoming solo artists for our label. Take this compilation as a first taste of where Textone is headed in 2004. To underscore our ambition of promoting netaudio past the confines of its current popularity epicenter in Western Europe, the contributors were picked from all four corners of the earth - well, two continents at least. Styles range from organic atmospheres via cut-up electro madness to classic technoid dancefloor stompers - but we won't tell you which is which. Just unwrap our belated sonic christmas packages one by one and let yourself be surprised.
