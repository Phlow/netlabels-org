  <description>Someday in summer of 1998 this local young rockband, majestik12, borrowed two microphones at the local youth center, plugged them into a tape recorder and recorded their songs live and without overdubs. You can tell the sound was corresponding to this equipment, but you will recognize the fun those guys had playing their music. They didn´t gave a shit about unique sound design or artistic homogenity. The recordings were released on tape and were sold at shows quite good.
Additional to the band recordings on the A- side, side B contains two improvised dub-jams and two remixes, one of them by yokölast.</description>
