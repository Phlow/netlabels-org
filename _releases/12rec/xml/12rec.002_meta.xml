  <description> Artisticly grown and with clear concepts majestik12 wanted to face their second release. Recorded on eight tracks, carefully microphoned and with best intentions, it took until 2001 to release the catfish took my girl ep. At this point the band wasnÂ´t really existing anymore, and there were no shows, where they could have presented their CD. So this might be a pretty unknown release to many people.
Moving beyond the naive crossover of the file not found: error lp to a colorful, heavy rocksound, that animated some people to comparisons to the QOTSA or Tortoise. The ep is freshed up with electronic add-ons and short skits and features a first remix by the sweet fuellsand boys.</description>
