  <description>kesselring's german vocals are the most important element in the und morgen, der asphalt-songs. the music is build around them, harmonically and structural. you can hear influences from 80's avantgarde-pop and independent-music; kesselring is not trying to sing most beautiful but lets the expression follow the content of his lyrics; you have to acclimatise because it sounds different from the music you use to know! maybe it's more easy if you can understand his surrealistic, dark and bloomy lyrics.
enough talk about the vocals! i told sim that und morgen, der asphalt always reminds me on a modell railway landscape, nice to look at in a whole and picked with dozen of details most people simply overlook. synth-sounds, field-recordings and electronic rhythm-patterns are entwined by guitar, bass, drums, piano (of course!), banjo. i don't know how these guys achieve a music this close and self-contained.

thanks to cryptic scenery for the remix, tanja elent√°ri nepomucky for the artwork and matija schellander for playing the contrabass at ich versuche dich zu lieben.</description>
