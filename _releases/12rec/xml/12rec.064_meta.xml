  <description>Russian duo THE RARE PLANTS GARDEN is beatmaker 813 and Nienvox, two fellows that made a good list of solo and cooperative appearances via Bump Foot, Dusted Wax Kingdom, 813âs own Pop Errors Gallery, and just recently Error Broadcast and Project Mooncircle. From this genealogy one might expect THE RARE PLANTS GARDEN to sound just like the other Russian duo here at 12rec., 2010âs high-flyer Monokle &amp; Galun. However 813 and Nienvox concentrate on psychedelic left-field Pop music, banning the razor-sharp future funk of 813 completely from THE RARE PLANTS GARDENs selftitled debut EP, making the six tracks suspicious being brainchild to Damon Albarn rather than Flying Lotus. 

In the aftermath of Britpop, acts like Gryff Rhys, Gorkyâs Zygotic Mynci, The Beta Band or Blur released awkward and subtle music that denied the grande gesture of Pop but offered beauty on second listen. THE RARE PLANTS GARDEN can be reviewed as heirs to this short-lived trend. Their compositions bow to 70s psychedelic Rock, UK Pop and Russian folklore simultaneously. Being well aware of what is happening in nowadays music however THE RARE PLANTS GARDEN do not sound retro a bit â the foggy and slightly mysterious sound of their EP would suit any hipsterâs âchillwaveâ and âwitchhouseâ act equally good. A stunning release.</description>
