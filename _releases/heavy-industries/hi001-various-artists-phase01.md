Our first release! This compilation includes all the original Heavy Industries collaborators including Danny, Emilsson, Simex, Fabrik, Phero, Phonon and Nimrod. We printed a very limited amount for this release but if you missed out the first time, all the tracks are now available here on the site. This release goes everywhere from hard tribal techno to dense trance, covering our preferred styles along the way, and remaining consistently danceable. phase01 was made to introduce our artists and to give an example of the styles we will be dealing with in the future. Although we won't be printing this again anytime soon, enjoy the mp3s and the very beginning of Heavy Industries.
