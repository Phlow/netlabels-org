With releases on Primevil and several other Swedish labels, Mikael Nykvist is no stranger to the game. His sharp and mature production style is immediately recognizable, a style that gives credit to the sounds of his homeland while offering an original take on the formula. Mike offers us four solid tracks that are quite DJ friendly and we encourage all the Final Scratch and Traktor users out there to take note. Bending Big begins the EP on a simple yet infectious note, a loopy track with an exceptionally sharp punch. Forward Flow continues in this vein of sharp and bright techno, a nice opening or segway track before things get a little rougher. This is evident as we hear Grooved Style - a change of mood occurs as the dirtier sounds of techno emerge. Mike ends on the strongest note with the title track Replaced. This is pure tribal techno, thick and chunky, yet still with that Section One flair of clean production values. If you are reading this right now, there is no excuse to not be downloading these tracks. Another perfect Heavy Industries release from Sweden!
