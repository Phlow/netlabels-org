This remix compilation is based on the opening track of hi006, Simex's lovely Under the Ocean. The feedback to this song - and EP - was so positive that we decided to offer the chance for other online producers to get involved with Heavy Industries and do some remixing. We were quite pleased with several of the mixes and we'd like to warmly thank everyone who contributed. Stylistically, hi007 is all over the place, ranging from funky electro, to lush tech-house, to atmospheric drum and bass, to dark ambient. This release is not just for Simex but for all the artists involved - they deserve equal attention and all relevant information is included in the ID3 tags of the mp3 files. Sit back, relax, and take a trip through some seriously addictive tracks that take Simex's original song to entirely new areas.
