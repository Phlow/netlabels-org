Heavy Industries returns to harder territory for the Sustain EP by Fabrik Nos. Emphasizing his interest in original techno, Fabrik gives us a wide range of tracks for a wide range of situations. The EP begins with the deep and slightly progressive Basement Love, infused with typical Fabrik Nos dark sound design yet funky enough for most listeners. Raising the tempo somewhat, Genetix hints at Fabrik's industrial roots with a strong minimal techno structure. Up next is Desert pt.1, a collaborative track with fellow HI producer Ryan Jones. This one is for all the hard techno heads out there and is a shining example of what can happen when two diverse producers come together in one studio. We conclude the EP with The Price, a tribute to the trancey, oldschool sound of NovaMute's Darren Price. Don't worry though, this isn't cheesy trance... The Price still has enough to please any techno enthusiast and was crafted from a modern standpoint. If you haven't heard Fabrik Nos before, this EP is a perfect introduction to his hybrid style. Just be sure to give it justice and play at appropriately loud levels.
