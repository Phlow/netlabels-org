Our first release for 2006 is the much-anticipated EP from Bochum, Germany residents, Björn Bommersheim and Bastian Götz, under the project title Ceroform. Their style can best be described as a mix between dancefloor-conscious and atmospheric, the type of techno you can throw into just about any set. We begin this versatile 4 tracker wtih the title track, Vicious Mind. Bittersweet melodies sit against deep consistent percussion at a laid back tempo. The tight yet breathable production makes it easy to mix where you want, but it's perfect for the end of the night. Wellen Schieben Welten follows more on the minimal tip, led by a vocoded German voice and quirky synths. Definitely a very original style in this one. HiCon brings us back to more typical Heavy Industries territory with sharp, hard, straightforward beats. Continuing to play with chord stabs, delays and swirling effects, Ceroform gives us a very workable number with enough uniqueness to set it apart from the typical looped club track. Finally we end the EP with a deep, clubby remix of Vicious Mind. This one is more suited to that peak hours moment and introduces some new synths and percussive loops. It's still around the original tempo though so it remains suitable for house or techno crowds.

This is one of those rare EPs you find online that has exactly the right amount of danceability and also attention to detail. We want to thank the Ceroform team for hooking us up with these tracks and we're honored to have them available to the public.
