The Things That Make You Happy is an album dedicated to those who love techno. This 12-track release travels through several forms of the style, from minimal to housey to hard to tribal to deep, making more than a few passing nods to trance along the way. Most of the release is upbeat and highly danceable, characterized by clean, crisp production, wide atmospherics and Fabrik's signature dark touch. Whether playing at an unhealthy volume in your car, or kept quiet in the background, hi003 is not only for the dj but the discerning listener as well.
