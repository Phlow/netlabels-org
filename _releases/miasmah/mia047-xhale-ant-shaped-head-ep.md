miasmah oldtimer xhale finally releases his first EP , delivering 3 soothing pieces of electronics. basoon blur and middle fountain representing ambient deepness and monotonik bass sounds layered with gentle warm moods. dry vinyl noises and spinning filmrolls .. adding a old film feeling. steady stroll on the other hand moves abit further down the road .. using dry electronic sounds intergrated with lurking melody lines. quite different from his last release.
