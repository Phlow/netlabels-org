moving abit away from the sunscaped music, we stop by the romanian city timisoara .. where we find 2 romanian cinematics called felix petrescu &amp; valentin toma working under their alias makunouchi bento. with help from stephanie courant &amp; dan damian they put together this magical, fimatic EP .. filled with french talking and slow downtempo beats.... mmm .. and now for a nap.
