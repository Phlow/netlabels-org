ahh it's that time again, time to put pen to paper and try to give you a folks some idea of what to expect from this ep. in days where experimentation and electronics seem to be the order of the day, we at miasmah thought it was high time to pay homage to our roots and what better way to do it than with aphilas' instrumentally ill ep. my notes tell me here we are presented with 'two finnish producers armed with second-hand vinyl and outdated software', need i say more? here we have the perfect accompaniment to those late night smoking sessions, hit repeat and toke on, this is the bristol sound too long forgotten.

1. lifelong fiction
2. that's just what it's for
3. collective memory loss
4. remain solid
5. blind matador techniques
6. the dubbed coil of smoke
