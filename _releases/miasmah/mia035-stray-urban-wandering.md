it's been a while since we released hiphop at miasmah but that's all fixed with this dirty ghetto style hiphop track from stray. listening to the track you can imagine wandering down a desolate bronx street may have inspired it, keep ya hand on yer gun bro - ahem - anyway, absolutley tip-top tune old bean, keep it real yo.
