  <description>binf brings yet more new blood to the miasmah tribe with slow-mo-house-beats that'll make you groooove baybee - can't get enough of those electronics ahh yeah. synth stabs and more knob twiddling antics than you can shake a stick at make for the most gorgeous 9 minutes of miasmah at its bedroom-meets-dancefloor best. hope to see more of this guy soon.. stay tuned.</description>
