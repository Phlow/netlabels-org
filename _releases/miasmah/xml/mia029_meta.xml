  <description>this new release from Solitaire albread (also known as xhale) is his first EP here at miasmah and is a little different from his previous releases. minimal is definitely the key word here - with subtle electronic touches backed by 4/4 beats Solitaire albread produces an original sound that is almost impossible to define, whilst at the same time he manages to stamp his distinct style on it. if you're a fan of his previous stuff you're going to love this new direction just as much - one love.</description>
