  <description>Having recently woken from his winter slumber, xhale brings us this jazzed-up-soulful-electronic-type-masterpiece featuring the talents of Frode Kloevtveit on trumpet. Originally released at the music disk "kaleidoskop" by level-d , he has decided to release a reworked version right here on miasmah. The unsettling melody and eerie pads will have you looking under you bed for goblins for sure - but somehow when you hear that trumpet get into full swing you can't help but feel safe. Warm + minimal this track is sure to make you groove..</description>
