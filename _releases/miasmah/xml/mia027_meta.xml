  <description>some time after the release of supine's debut ep on miasmah we're glad to see him back with another killer track. his talent on the keys shines through again, beautiful melodies and subtle pads make for an easy take-off into a clear sky. miasmah is flying high.. come feel it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is the remastered version -&gt; Thanx to Uwe Holland (Parkstudios)</description>
