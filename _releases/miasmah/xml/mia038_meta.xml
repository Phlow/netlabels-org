  <description>This time we have an exclusive mini-EP by a San Fransisco located triphop/downbeat band called Karmacoda. Lushious pads, beutifull melodies and abstract sounds all wrapped in a deliciously downbeated manner, is some of what you can excpect from these 3 americans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Amsterdam room works as pure dark sounding intstrumental track.. with a steady beat flowing through. While Motion picture.. with its melancholic feel, intriguing sounds, and extreme laidback singing is a definite hit, for warm summer night listening. Want more? go check out their discography at &lt;a href="http://www.karmacoda.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;karmacoda&lt;/a&gt;</description>
