  <description>Supine is back yet another time with more lushiously melodic tunes, backed by a 
long and deep house version of "just as a woman" by solitaire albread. 
This is your chance to dream your way out from the wintery cold streets, too warm beaches
and cool drinks. Put on one of these babies, kick back in your favorite chair, and feel as
the pacific sunset draw you in. chill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thanx alot to Uwe holland at &lt;a href="http://www.parkstudios.net" rel="nofollow"&gt;parkstudios&lt;/a&gt; for mastering tracks #a through #d</description>
