  <description>krii (tokyodawn records) and aleks (mo playaz) hit miasmah with a smooth hiphop piece that takes you by the hand and throws you headlong into the dirtiest jazz bar uptown. the heady bassline and ohsosweet sax cuts paint an image so vivid you can almost smell that cigar smoke curling up around you. swap your mouse for a whisky and play the game.. god knows these guys are.</description>
