if you go down to the woods today, you're sure of a big surprise - who are those mystical tree people? well, only opiate knows the answer to that, all we can do is imagine what could have inspired this dark and moody downbeat piece. haunting choirs and abstract beats coupled with electronic elements make this release something rather special - open your eyes and take a trip into wonderland.
