gazing asteroid .. its laidback, its funky, its jazzy , its housy .. this is just some of what tells you about this wonderful track. again we move abit away from the wintery madness, and take you into the relaxing warmth. the sun just seems to move its way onto your face, when listening to this tune.. and what a funky bass!
