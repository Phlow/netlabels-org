are you human? am i human? am i here? i for one have considerable difficulty answering these questions and apparently 4t thieves does too - but that's ok, because this debut release is something quite sublime. cool and simple these two tracks will immerse you deep into a comatosed state.. ..unable to do anything.. ..except mumble.. and swear blind you can see cute little fishies floating around - here little fishy.. am i a fish?
