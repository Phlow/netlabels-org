second EP release by u.s resident transient shows the musically variation skills the man has. Extremely beutiful soundscape ambients floating around like peace itself. Follows up the style from the lighted apartment comp. earlier released on miasmah. It feels like time stops when the air conditioning sound of cemetary sunset persists. This is for cooling down after heating in the sun throughout the day.
