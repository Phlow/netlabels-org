For those familiar with the netlabel scene, Paul Keely is a man who needs no introduction. After his acclaimed releases on Thinner and Panospria, here he is finally on Epsilonlab, with 4 of his finest tracks to date.

Starting with the very funky "I can't stop", where we can find elements of a certain well known song (?), on to "New Seclusion" and "Communique", two tracks with irresistable grooves and surprising sensitivity, and finally ending up at "Neutron Funk", which hits us like a funky uppercut to the teeth.

It hurts, but it hurts good.

1. I Can't (Stop)
