Red velvet draping a staircase, antique frescoes lining up a hallway. Surreal music flooding the hallway from a slightly ajar door at its end.

Step into Frivolous' musical world, where one discovers a sound and emotions filled to the brim with forgotten treasures via arrangements forged through the frivolous spirit of our friend from western Canada.

This time, Dirty Jam Gigohm collaborated with our Karloff records old-timer to produce a classic from the 1950s revisited via electronica. This remodeled track will go straight for the heart, thanks to M. Gigohm.
