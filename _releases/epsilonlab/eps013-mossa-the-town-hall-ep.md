What went wrong at the town hall in NY on the night of Oct 12, 1962?

Mossa, via his latest release which definitely differs from his usual material, takes you back to that moment at the New York Town Hall when Charles Mingus and his 30 musicians made history. Yesterday's best jazz elements and today's funky rhythms blend in Mossa's hands through three pieces that will deserve a prominent spot in your musical entertainment collection.

As if it wasn't enough, the instant classic "Town Hall - Take One" gets the Eloi Brunelle treatment.

1. Town Hall - Take One
2. Town Hall - Take Two
3. Town Hall - Take Three

Run time 23:02
