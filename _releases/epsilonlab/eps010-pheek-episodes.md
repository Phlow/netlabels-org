As the first to join forces with Éloi Brunelle as part of Epsilonlab (December 2000), in fact, Pheek is definitely an old-timer. He finally returns to us with "Épisodes" after two CD albums, namely "Paysages Matriciels" and recently "Les autres promeneurs", and a contribution to the well known "Audiotherapy" DVD project.

Anyone in the know will tell you - Pheek loves groovy minimal rhythms and way-out sounds. No one can argue that he strayed from his tastes this time. Throw in ambient samples and old movies lines and you get a very unique and mysterious release, Epsilonlab.com's 10th to date.
