Here's a man who definitely needs no introduction: Eloi Brunelle, man at the center and founder of the Epsilonlab label. This explosive release still red hot from the lab's furnaces and destined to shine demonstrates how his sound is threaded with his personality.

Open those ears and receive the very essence of Epsilonlab, via four distinctive tracks with souls of their own. It's a roller-coaster ride starting with a biting, deep intro transforming into the energy of the mad scientist and his contraptions sliding through a warm, festive jet stream rouding up with a slow concoction that will make you smile.

Caution: Do not mix with any other substance.
