The Piknic Electronik in Montreal are an increasingly popular event held on Sunday afternoons, which features a variety of local djs playing under the sun, and are an ideal way to wind down the weekend. This year, the organisers decided they needed a theme song, and Eloi was recruited for the job.

The task was special in that they needed not only a simple soundtrack, but rather something that represented the different styles of music featured at the events, which ranges from deep house to techno, via electro and drum & bass.

Along with the original version, we bring you 3 remixes by different artists in the Epsilonlab stable; Mossa with a more organic interpretation, Pheek with a hypnotic, minimal version, and last but not least Mateo Murphys intense yet melodic remix. An essential addition to your daily musical intake.
