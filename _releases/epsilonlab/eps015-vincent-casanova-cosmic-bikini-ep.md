Vincent's second release on Epsilonlab is best consumed either on a rainy sunday afternoon or on a sunny beach, carried by subtle dance steps. Once again, his masterful beats and ambiance skills are showcased by a series of strong melodic compositions which will whisk you away, each in a different direction.

All tracks combine to create an emotionally rich menu where each dish is as unique as a Cosmic Bikini.

1. Send The Probe
2. Sleepy
3. South Brazil
4. Bonzai Love
