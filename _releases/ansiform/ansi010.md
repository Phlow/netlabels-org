alien waves lap against a shore of soothing, yet desolate tones, zipping forwards and backwards in time while being gently punctuated by soft metallic stabs and scrapes. the morphing mass of sound resembles that of a chugging train at times, at others like the genesis of some imaginary violin-saxophone-harp hybrid... deeply evocative of a dense cloud formed of mixed emotions and half-faded memories.
