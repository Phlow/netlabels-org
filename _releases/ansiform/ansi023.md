archive.org, the benevolent host of our media, has been experiencing growing pains as of late, injecting another unintended gap into our release schedule... no matter...once you've surrounded yourself with the calm cooling colors of 'sleepy eyes', i'm sure you'll agree it was worth the wait.

the internet archive is such an important resource for netlabels and the public in general. we'd like to thank the staff gratuitously for the invaluable service they provide..
