forgive the inevitable summer lull in production... has it really been three weeks plus? we've got a track that sizzles and pops appropriately for a hot sleepless summer night... maybe this is the soundtrack to a mosquito making a meal of your red stuff. pretty ugly or ugly-pretty... take your pick.
