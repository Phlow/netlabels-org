much of the music we release is the perfect accompaniment to a good night's sleep... this track, however, is a soundtrack to a sleepless night. it's driven by a mildly dissonant theme (not unlike the alien riffs synonymous with AFX's Ambient II) that changes colors like a chameleon. be forewarned that there are a few moments that might be considered jarring, which may be a first among tracks in our collection.
