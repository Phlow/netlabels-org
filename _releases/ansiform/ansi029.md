'each year of our lives' is our thirtieth anonymous, ambient release, but is our first in a few respects; this is the first ansiform release composed of several movements (3), and consequently the longest (spanning nearly a half hour). it's also the first to be plainly guitar-based. a marvellous mood-lifter at any volume.
