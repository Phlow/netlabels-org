here's something slightly out of character for us... it's beatless to be sure, but it's not quite ambient, in truth. "i can't swim" is a short but demanding listening experience and stands in stark contrast with the majority of the ansiform catalogue. very unsettling on first listen, but it becomes eerily comfortable with increasing familiarity.
