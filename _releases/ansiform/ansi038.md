at 39 releases and counting, we're still considerably young in the scheme of things, and we're glad to slowly broaden our collective's aesthetic scope with tracks such as "qetoret (gong fog)". this superficially sparse but fascinatingly layered piece is one of a select few in our catalogue to feature discernible vocal elements, however incomprehensible.
