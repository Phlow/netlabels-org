perhaps it's ironic that 'it only hurts when i think about it'  is hard to think about, even by our standards. it's so innocuous that it practically begs to be ignored. if you manage to bring it to the forefront of your attention you'll be pleased by the surprisingly evocative texture of the lone instrument -- like a plucked oboe, or a reeded violin.
