For our second net release we present "Aliens in My Bathroom" EP by critically acclaimed minimal-techno producer from St.Petersburg. Oira appears to be one of the interesting electronic producers in St.Petersburg with his innovative style. And this current work, released by our net-label, shows his vision of techno music - dry, dancefloor-oriented with straightforward experiments.
