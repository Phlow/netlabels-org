Leibniz brings you 5th release, this time from Kontext (Stanislav Sevostyanikhin). Double standards EP comes with the typical Kontext sound when dubby elements meet minimal electronica, spiced with atmospheric and glitchy sounds. So he knows a thing or two about originality and details, that is for sure.
