Maybe there are something of summer in these sounds, but very strange summer. Nostalgic, unknown and sometimes rainy. From track to track of "Tripin Disco" you drifting above different summer places, even above solar beach on the sun.
Now you can spend your summertime staring at the Sun without sunglasses and there is no any chance to get sunburn or even sunstroke because this "Tripin" Sun is kind of unusual, with unpredictable behavior.

Follow the "Triping Disco" Sun!
