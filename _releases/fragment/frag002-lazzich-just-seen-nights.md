"Just Seen Nights" is absolutely light, sometimes alcoholic cocktail made of positive and light emotions that you can make before, during or even after your sleep.

It's just like surfing through clouds with your best friends. Drive your sofa through the highest rainforest trees, navigate your submarine between skyscapers, hunt the sky fish...

Don't be surprised with your neighbours abnormal behavior, when they try to dive right out of their windows in order to accompany you in this atmospheric journey.

There is even a bit of erotic in this release, in case you decide to float with your lover.

Fasten your seatbelts!
