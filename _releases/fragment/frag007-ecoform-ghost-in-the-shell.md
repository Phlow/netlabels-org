These are the sounds of kindergarten life at forenoon, noon and afternoon time. Somebody experiences euphoric calm, somebody thinks he is doing something really important for all human beings by launching nearly dead teddy bear towards the sun.

Sit still and watch your alter ego falls into the pink swimmingpool.
Drive your small, remote controlled car between dishes and cups on the kitchen table. Anyway batteries wont die this time.
