Steps for Kids Remixed is a collection of techno remixes suitable for the youngest of our listeners, those who make their first steps.
Several artists interpreted and enriched the sound of the light and airy Steps For Kids. The original was one of the tracks on formerly released Lazzich LP "Just Seen Nights".

We hope you enjoy those interpretations!
