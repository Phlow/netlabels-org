  <description>&lt;b&gt;The waking drum machine.&lt;/b&gt;

Here is a very dreamy EP we received from synthpop duo Shaun &amp; Andrea , better known as Symphonic Stereo ,  who debuted on the well-received Starving But Happier comp earlier this year.

For this release we have five songs of tranquilizing, reverberated vocals grounded by modest bass-snare-hihat drum patterns - lending to similarities with Figurine or perhaps The Russian Futurists under general anesthesia.

Standout tracks include the nicely balanced "Lorn/Tara", "Come Over" with its upbeat vibraphone melody, and the lulling "Slowest Emotion" with a bass-driven melody and shuffling rhythm.

The group is also curating an upcoming mp3 compilation called Love Tara and has another netlabel release planned for later this autumn, so stay tuned. </description>
