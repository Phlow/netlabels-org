**Paintings of a passing world**

In a sort of poltergeist narrative, the latest work from Gultskra Artikler is an expression of details and ideas - some structured, many not - formed in a way that simultaneously establishes and challenges a pattern language. 

With all kinds of noisy threats thrown in the way, Razmer Nosa 46 designates with the faintest markers a gradually steadying sequence of disturbances and rewarding plateaus. It's an odd world of wandering acoustic basses, jarring synth abstractions, livid percussion, and beautiful choral re-arrangements.

Like trying to describe the world left behind a fast moving train, or a racing mind.

Gultskra Artikler is from Novosibirsk, Russia.
