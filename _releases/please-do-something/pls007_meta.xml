  <description>&lt;b&gt;The fractured temperament.&lt;/b&gt;

Colophon is the multi-talented Ed Powley (York, UK). I first heard his brilliant expositions in densely layered post-rock by downloading the "Imprint/Tailpiece" EP at Nishi a few months ago. He uses a formula of power, beauty, and silence. How these elements are proportioned is the real work of art here -- it is done with great dexterity, often resulting in songs which feel unusually triumphant.

Like bits of stuff from a cancelled dream involving Slint, Mogwai, and Eno.

Anyway, what I like about this music is the sort of lyrical personality to wholly instrumental songs. The bass-driven melody in "Never return to the place where everything went awry", for example, is a technique missing in a lot of modern music but rather skillfully employed here. Lazy snares, start/stop syncopation, and an icy subdued melodic drift make "It's beautiful man, but so cold..." another standout track.

I'm already looking forward to the next Colophon release. One of my favorite new artists of the year. And don't forget to listen to the earlier EP at Nishi. </description>
