Having fixed an exploded cable modem (just by swearing at it), one of our best friends, Connor Kirby-Long, is back -- this time with three new songs he wrote between classes and they're full of all kinds of well-crafted good stuff: pretty guitar melodies, spazzy cut-up percussion, bendy synth notes, and angelic vocals.

In the first track, 'Crapstone', Connor takes a handfull of loose stuff found in his jacket pocket and turns it into a daydreamy pop tune. And where 'The eyes of the older drivers' is a sort of carnivalesque examination of, um, older people driving, "Basement Key 555" is the grand and densely-produced foreshadowing of his upcoming album this spring on the stylish &lt;a href="http://www.typerecords.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;Type Records&lt;/a&gt; label with its heavy piano melody and catchy ending.

Should be a good year for Khonnor fans.
