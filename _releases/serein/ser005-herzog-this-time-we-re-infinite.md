Just three months have passed since Herzog's last EP release at Serein, and we are delighted to welcome him back with the follow up, 'This time we're infinite'. Since his debut release I had been eagerly awaiting fresh material and I was not disappointed. This EP (which is perhaps closer to being a mini-album, at over thirty minutes in length) further builds upon Herzog's love of fragmented sound and gently unfolding rhapsodies.

The pieces comprise of three shorter compositions, leaving the final eighteen minutes of 'Look at us only through microscopes now' until last. What makes this music so special is the artist's ability to surprise throughout, with a sound that borrows from the world of post-rock and folk through to French cinema, it is perhaps unsurprising that the result is so special.

1. standing like towers, in a field, in the rain
2. a short exchange of words by the triangulation point
3. these roads are ribbons in the countryside
4. look at us only through microscopes now
