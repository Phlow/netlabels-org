From the chilly climes of Scotland we present to you Herzog, with the aptly named Autumn Parade EP (fast becoming winter up there, I should imagine!). Continuing the low key electronic feel of the last release, Herzog seems to strip back this sound even more - revealing a minimal, warm and deeply sophisticated sound. Another five tracks here then of the most wonderful electronic music; this is fodder for the cold nights closing in around us.

1. caterwaul
2. milksnatcher
3. my bed is my boat
4. bellwether iii
5. no headlights, no brakes
