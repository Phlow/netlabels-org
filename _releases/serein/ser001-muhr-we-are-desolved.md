It is with great pleasure that we bring you the first release at Serein, by Canadian artist Muhr. Five tracks in all comprising sampled instrumentation, field recordings and carefully layered sound synthesis. A conceptual follow up to his release at Miasmah, Muhr has once again managed to deliver a beautifully sparse and organic sound that is becoming very much his own. We look forward to hearing more from him in the near future!
