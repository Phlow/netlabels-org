It started as a joke but in the end it just seemed too ridiculously appropriate, and here it is. Six very different takes on the classic theme ranging from Mesu Kasumai's detroit electro throwdown, Sabastian Boaz's maniacal casio n' bass frenzy and Twilight Electric's honest and innocent synthpop mix, to Nullsleep's pure nintendo love, Ten and Tracer's hauntingly melancholic surprise and Yuppster's pumping SID attack, it is undoubtedly an essential collection.
