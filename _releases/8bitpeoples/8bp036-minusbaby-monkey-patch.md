My earliest memory of a monkey is the scene in "Kingukongu tai Gojira" where King Kong opens a giant snake's mouth so far beyond it's natural extention point that it eventually looks like a mushroom with a long, wiggly, scaled stem. Sure, King Kong is an ape but to a 4 year old, it was a very big monkey with an attitude problem. It was also pretty bad-ass.

So, in return for playfully horrific imagery, I managed to write an album dedicated to all things apish and monkeyed. Don't accept any imitations, this album is more real than Diddy Kong's learned vocabulary.
