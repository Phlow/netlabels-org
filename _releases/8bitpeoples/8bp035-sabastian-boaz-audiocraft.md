Audiocraft is a trip though Sabastian's interpretation of the 1980s, from the synth rock of Heart Error to the creepy electro of Little Rubber Buttons. A departure from his earlier work, this cd packs a punch of flamboyant catchy synths, heavy electro bass lines and slamming drums. If you want to dance or maybe throw yourself around singing like you're Steve Perry this CD is for you.
