With influences such as classic game soundtracks and Tin Pan Alley evergreens, mixed with the sounds of 20th century atonality and Salvation Army hymns, I have created a collage of musical scenes depicting adolescence in the dawn of the third millennium. The songs are entirely made with the MCK system, which should vouch for a genuine twenty-minute NES experience.
