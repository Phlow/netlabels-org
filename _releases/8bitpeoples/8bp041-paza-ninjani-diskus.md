Take one Atari ST, one microphone, a toy keyboard with animal sounds, throw in a few UFOs along with some ninjas and colliding asteroids and you have 'Ninjani Diskus' Paza's debut release on 8bitpeoples. So pump up the volume and let Paza take you on a nonstop YM2149 thrillride through all of the levels and right to the highscore with his powerful and addictive blipps. This release contains the strength of 10 ninjas wailing on guitars.
