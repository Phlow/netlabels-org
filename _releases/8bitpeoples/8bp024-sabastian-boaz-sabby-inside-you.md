Part one of this two part series shows me flex my muscles as a lo-fi, sex god, rock star. Unlike all of my earlier multitracked work, this was mostly sequenced with a pc and a commodore128. Sounds ripped from a talking wrist watch, my house doorbell, a mac lc and many toy keyboards such as the casio vl-tone in "one vanquished leopard."
