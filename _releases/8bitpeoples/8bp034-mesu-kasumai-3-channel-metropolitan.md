Get ready for another round of fresh and funky electrochip madness with Mesu Kasumai. This follow-up to his party-rocking debut remains true to the style he set there, only this time treating us to completely original material. Mesu synthesizes powerups from pure waveforms before sending them flying on vectors straight into your ears like blazing starfighters from the 8bitpeoples galactic empire. In the final tune you will be subjected to an amusingly gruesome end, but you can be sure that we have not seen the last of Mesu Kasumai!
