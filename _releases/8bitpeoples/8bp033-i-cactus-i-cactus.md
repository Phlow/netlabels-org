The deliciously delayed debut release from I, Cactus brings you a short collection of sweet tunes filled with heartbreakingly innocent melodies. As you stroll along with the sun at your back, one cute cactus after another bouncing happily behind you, with this carefree blend of chippy harmonies and clicky crunchy beats you'll never look at a cactus the same way again. Featuring such treasures as "Bamboo Cactus" an unforgettable remix of Nullsleep's "Playful Panda" - this little cactus packs a big punch!
