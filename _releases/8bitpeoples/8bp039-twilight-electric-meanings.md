Twilight Electric's "Meanings" touches on three important aspects of life. The Self Portrait, gaining an understanding of yourself in the most raw and honest form. True Fidelity, being dedicated to one sincere cause and sticking with it, through thick and thin. And Stepping Back, taking a moment to stop and look at all that you have achieved and endured. "Meanings" is presented through a triad of instrumental movements and based around the casio vl-1. In memory of Twilight Electric and Nullsleep's father, Todd Fliss 1958-2004.
