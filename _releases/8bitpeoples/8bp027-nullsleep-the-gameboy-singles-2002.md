A roughly chronological collection ranging from some of my earliest gameboy tunes to the ones written in 2002. While the first half presents an innocent fun approach (aside from the harder edge of Harm Parm), the concluding three tracks show a maturation in both style and technique. A must have for high school makeout parties.
