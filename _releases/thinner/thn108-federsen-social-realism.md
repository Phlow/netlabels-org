'social realism' is the debut release of the london based 
artist federsen. his debut ep contains three original tracks 
which drift between gently sequenced chords upon lush beats 
and subtle details on the fx. this one is for those who like 
it smooth and atmospheric - laidback electronic music for the 
pre-summer between the poles of detroit, chillout and house! 
last but not least we asked sensual physics to complete the 
ep with a remix for you! 

'nature Of mind' kicks things off with plashy beats and 
mildly vocoded breathings. the following track 'all things 
are numbers' is more enigmatic and glances in between hall 
rooms on a slow 808 beat, while 'epoch' is a tad more 
uplifting with it's driving chords, twirling effects and 
detroit arpeggios. last but not least we asked sensual 
physics to complete the ep with a remix to prepare the people 
for his coming new album on thinner! his mix builds on a 
single long stretched chord to later develop into a slender, 
yet concentrated clubby opener, which is open and warm at 
the same time.
