Whether it's Marsen Jules composing beautiful orchestral-
ambient music using carefully sampled fragments of sound or 
krill.minima creating warm, exotic soundscapes from novel 
combinations of ambient, electronica, and dub, Martin Juhls 
is the German artist behind these well known aliases and the 
inviting, poignant, and atmospheric sounds. "Urlaub auf 
Balkonien" is Martin's most recent netlabel release using 
his moniker krill.minima and is his second virtual album on 
Thinner under this guise.

It was four years ago that krill.minima made his debut 
netlabel appearance with the Thinner release "Zwischen zwei 
und einer Sekunde" surprising listeners and reviewers alike 
with its personal and inimitable experimental concoction of 
ambient and dub influences.  Appropriately subtitled "exotic 
warm ambient dub", the album opened up a whole new corridor of 
sound for those listeners who savored more experimental/unusual 
variations of electronic music.  Other virtual albums by 
krill.minima appear on the Stadtgruen and Misamah netlabels 
along with physical releases on the Genesungswerk and 
Microcosm Music labels not to mention numerous remixes and 
compilation appearances on various labels.

With "Urlaub auf Balkonien", krill.minima presents nine 
pensive songs of laidback, ambient-dub in its most refined 
form rich in elegiac melodies, reverbed chords, glassy pads, 
relaxed bass lines, warm vinyl hiss, and ever so gentle 
beats.  In Germany, "Urlaub auf Balkonien" is an idiom that 
alludes to spending one's summer holidays at home, and the 
album is thematically centered around taking pleasure in 
relaxed German summer days.  However, "Urlaub auf Balkonien" 
goes beyond locale and ethos, having a more universal 
relevance, reflecting in sound a varied, introspective, and 
sensual array of summer moods, feelings, and images.   As you 
listen to these songs, a layer of melancholic ambiance is 
evident.  Drifting in and out, this melancholy is emblematic 
of the depression that arises as summer nears and the mind 
seeks respite from the dull routine of daily life.  But 
embedded even deeper into the fabric of the songs is a more 
prevalent atmosphere of contentment. A holiday mood 
effortlessly manifests itself as the relaxed sounds redirect 
the mind away from the mundane to  thoughts of carefree, warm 
days and balmy evenings.
