After 9 very successful releases we go back to the roots and start a new batch of releases with a compilation featuring various artists. Through the past months many artists contacted us for releasing their material on Thinner. We now compiled a sampler which features uprising artists who probably are soon to be found on Thinner with own eps. Enjoy 46 minutes of new sophisticated sounds from The thinner collective.

The compilation starts with a pretty lounged new Benfay work, unlike the "Carbon" ep which was the yet most banging Thinner release, "Smokey" is a very relaxed piece of mellow fusion techhouse with moody moments. The latvian talent Selffish from the fairly new baltic independent record label "+371 Records" submitted an atmospheric idm-dsp fusion masterpiece. A trippy 10 minutes voyage with smooth layers folding and unfolding. The australian Chimera of hellven (soon a LP on Tim Kochs excellent Surgery records) gave us an intelligent grooving microhouse cut with weird voices and blips, in soft Akufen style. My debut as Sebastian Redenz on Thinner is a monotonic techhouse song covered in string-o-mania ;). Sub.q collaborated with Th0ke for a deep groovy minimal techno cut with deep filtered hook sequences. From finland we introduce Timo Saikkonen who submitted a dark dark atmospheric monotone minimal groover.
