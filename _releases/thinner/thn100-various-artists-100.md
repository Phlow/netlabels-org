Obviously reaching the century mark in any endeavor is a 
milestone and is cause for celebration. In the case of 
netlabel Thinner, it's release number 100 and this calls for 
a compilation to celebrate this special occasion. And there's 
another reason to celebrate - the compilation also marks the 
relaunch of the Thinner netlabel. So here's an opportunity to 
hear an aural digest of Thinner's past and present and to have 
a glimpse into it's future. A most fitting way to bring this 
year to a close and serve as an impetus for the new year.

Simply titled "100", the compilation brings together thirteen 
artists who exemplify the Thinner sound. Many of the 
contributors are renown Thinner artists and/or have strong 
associations with the label, and several artists have only 
recently made their first appearance on the Thinner. Whether 
established or new, each of these artists does his part in 
epitomizing what Thinner music is all about while, at the same 
time, etching themselves into the minds of the listeners as 
they dish out an assortment of top-notch electronic music 
embodying such genres as dub (and its many dub-inspired 
manifestations), minimal house, minimal techno, and unique 
fusions of dub, house, and techno. An assortment of ambiances 
are to be found here ranging from laidback lounge to 
dance-floor friendly.

Veer gets the album off to a modish start with some classic dub 
that includes spoken word and vocals. Calming things down with 
some slow-moving, bass-laden, atmospheres, Daniel Blomqvist 
presents his experimental take on the traditional dub sound. 
Tracks 3 - 6 show Thinner's more minimal techno side not only 
with contributions by veteran Thinner artists Unit 21 and 
Benfay but also a collaboration between Jason Corder and Pheek 
working together as Social System and new face to the Thinner 
roster, one Daniel Herrmann performing as Trace, who dishes 
out some strong vocal-laden techno. 

Sensual Physics sets the mood for tracks 7 - 11 which delve 
heavily into the minimal/deep house sound featuring well known 
artists Brian Kage, Epsilonlab label founder Eloi Brunelle, and 
Das Kraftfuttermischwerk not to mention a track from the 
mysterious recent Thinner newcomer Laura Palmer.  As "100" 
nears its conclusion, Off the Sky and Gyges present a rather 
unclassifiable track of crunchy, laidback experimental 
environments before the album makes full circle and transitions 
back to the signature Thinner sound of the beginning with a 
closing piece by Deluge who has composed a beautiful track of 
organic dub accentuated with acoustic samples.

So celebrate along with Thinner as it reaches a new landmark in 
it's existence by downloading "100" and immerse yourself in the 
Thinner experience.
