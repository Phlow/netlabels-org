After our overwhelming Canadian strike, we return to ground with a calm EP by Marko Fürstenberg. if you didnt know it yet, its Surphase (formerly Dolby) under his new guise for calm movers. The tracks are the perfect audial review for the great time we spent there. Markos love for the Basic Channel and Thule sounds are once again obvious - long evolving spheres, expanding dubchords and cold stabs merged with closed hihats and dark basses draw through all tracks, yet they still sound unique each of its own. 4 perfect options to enjoy and relax. Inspired by the canadian love for cats, Digitalverein designed a cover of Maximes cat looking out of the window.
