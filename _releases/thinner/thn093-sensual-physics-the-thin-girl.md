There has been a lengthy lull between Joerg Schuster's "Changes 
LP" in 2004 and this new Sensual Physics release. In between 
Joerg released the "Expanding Itself" EP on Epsilonlab though
his alter egos Lufth and Digitalverein basically remained on 
hiatus since then. Now, finally, with "The Thin Girl" Thinner 
is extremly proud to release four gems of the huge backstock 
Joerg has accumulated over the past years. 

Originally the four tracks on "The Thin Girl" derive from a 
live set which Joerg used to play as Sensual Physics. These 
tracks conjure up memories or moments that link to 
infinitesimal frozen slices of time, created to last 
indefinitely. Being influenced by the time being, these four 
parts of the original live set have been rejuvenated and 
renewed. In re-recording each piece, Joerg carves out the 
essence of the original track and builds on that. 

Each piece is distilled with a touch of accident. Whether it 
be a small break, a crackle or some fading reverb, these 
random elements expand the basic theme behind Joerg's creation 
of each track which are just developed further from there, 
iterated, and reassembled until the pieces fit together 
perfectly. Beside these chaotic and analytical elements all 
tracks are sensualwise carried out by warm floating basslines 
and dreamy soundscapes even if the track would be entitled 
"Out Of Sense". 

Like zooming into a piece of fractal art, the listener gets 
deeper and deeper into the tracks which include soft pieces 
of chaotic elements being more or less sussed out. Listening 
more intently and analytically, the mind starts recognizing 
each sound being distinct from the other ones such as in 
"Garden Of Apples", and when it begins putting the pieces 
back together again, it surprisingly finds that none of 
these tracks sounds exactly the same way the others did. 

Where vocals are involved, they are concerned with the 
immediate moment like in "Closer To You". This one, in 
particular, stands at a distance from the other tracks 
because of the space between the questioning, sensual voice 
which gives it a particularly enlivening and mysterious edge 
by comparison.

So "The Thin Girl" is an interweaved mixture of analysis and 
warmth. And, just after diving deep into a track, the listener 
soon feels its approaching end only to start sinking into the 
next one.

Joerg would like to thank the Freesoundarchive Community 
Project, as some of the voice snippets used in "Close To You" 
originate from there.
