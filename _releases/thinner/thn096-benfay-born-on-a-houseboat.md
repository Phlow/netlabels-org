After an absence of far too long,  Benfay makes a welcome 
return to Thinner. His last appearance on the netlabel was in 
January 2005 when he teamed up Irish singer Alice Mackay on 
the  “Lighthouse EP” [THN068] delivering four tracks of vocal 
minimal house.  Now, two and one-half years later, he’s back 
with “Born on a Houseboat”  where the houseboat is a metaphor 
for a “floating community sharing a love for one style of 
music.”  The style here is nearly a half-an-hour’s worth of 
delicious beat-laden grooves and urbane minimal house 
contained in four tracks.

Concerning the general flavor of the sounds, you’ll find 
traditional stab chords and pads and danceable beats generated 
with an analog drum machine.  In addition, Benjamin says that 
he’s working with the imperfections of “human microgrooves” 
and blending the “digital domain with warm analogue dirt” 
often running sounds from digital virtual instruments through 
a sequence of analog devices.

“Breaching the Escarp” which means “breaking through the 
precipice” (referring to Ben’s hobby of climbing) begins with 
a staccato melody which Benjamin says sounds like a “doggerel.” 
But when the high hat enters and the stab chords and drum 
machine beats come in the groove on this piece takes off and 
there‘s no going back.  The sound of a tire rolling on sand 
initiates “Phlegmatic Face” tinting it with some scratchy 
vinyl warmth.  A melancholic dub ambiance coupled with a 
steady beat and a continuous bass line speckled with watery 
droplets of melody give the piece an overall carefree, 
“rolling through life” mood.  The sad tone of “Phlegmatic 
Face”  is quickly overtaken by the sugary summertime grooves 
of “Nimiety of Energy.”  Wavering pads and a solid high hat 
impart the feeling of a warm summer breeze while simple 
melodies played on miniature Carl Orff instruments bring a 
touch childlike playfulness.  Benjamin’s personal favorite is 
“Quick Drifter” - a slow-moving piece of minimal house loaded 
with stab chords, hot synthesized bass lines, catchy rhythms, 
and clever breaks.
