The 102nd release of Thinner features Leif, an artist hailing 
from North Wales. In between working in a corporate day job, 
partying hard, drinking a lot of coffee, and chopping wood to 
keep his house warm, Leif runs UK based label Trimsound with 
his close friends Tom and Joe Ellis. Next to numerous releases 
on his own label, Leif has had releases on Morris Audio, Moon 
Harbour, Frankie, Telegraph, Logistic, Textone, Archipel and 
Floppy Funk. 

He also DJs and performs live with Tom Ellis as "Trimsound 
Live", bringing together live waves of sound using hardware 
sequencers, laptop and live bass guitar. We're very proud to 
welcome this multitasking talent, who introduces himself to 
the Thinner people with The "Benrhos Dubs" EP, a cycle of three
techhouse tracks, both pumping yet full of smooth dubs at the 
same time. Additionally the EP features a remix by thinner 
native T-Polar, who has an album upcoming. 

Starting with the moody "Long Way Round" Leif offers a moody 
pumping techhouse track with smooth dubs, perfect to utilize 
in a progressing DJ set. "New Growth" is more of a laidback 
nature and suprises with an airy flute. The claps are emitted 
in wide hall rooms and percussive elements dribble on a carpet 
of gentle moody pads. The third piece "The Tempo Of My 
Indicator" goes into a different direction, here the dry and 
quirky side of Leif is on his best behaviour, when he assembles 
sets of functional patterns by glueing frazzles of organs, 
vocals with a playful percussive potpourri. The cherry on the 
cake is the remix by T-Polar, who is grinding the original 
track in towards dark and humid canals, putting a massively 
saturated bassline, a yummy teaser for his next thinner 
longplay. Altogether, a box of diverse tracks, energetic and 
functional to spice up the night.
