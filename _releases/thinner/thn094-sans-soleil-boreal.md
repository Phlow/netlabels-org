07.05.2007 | MOBILE ELECTRONIC SATELLITE]

Laden with field recordings, voices, and processed pop-music 
samples "of the most sugary-sweet, top-40 kind" Canadian 
audio-visual artist Michael Trommer makes his first 
appearance on netlabel Thinner as Sans Soleil with a virtual 
long-player of intelligent pop-flavored techno given the title 
of "Boreal". The title itself which means of or relating to 
northern regions gives a clue as to the theme behind the 
music. "Boreal" follows in the footsteps of other releases by 
Michael on various electronic/experimental music labels such 
as Transmat, Stasisfield and many others.

Inspired in part by his "fascination with landscape" which 
has its origins in the Canadian mannerism of deriving at 
least part of their national identity from the topography 
and climate of the land itself, the music on "Boreal" helps 
close the gap between pure dance-floor oriented music and the 
more experimental, electro-acoustic works that he creates for 
his audio installations and as part of the sound-video 
improvision collective I/O Media.  Michael refers to "Boreal" 
as "a mobile soundtrack for a walk through the snow...dancing 
in your head."  

As you listen to the seven compositions encompassing "Boreal" 
you'll hear a clever fusion of techno and pop music with 
synthesized sounds and field recordings. There are no fillers 
to be found here. Every song is unique and robust in its own 
right. Aggressive techno beats and warm dance-floor rhythms 
are tempered with a dulcet layer of pop samples and familiar 
environmental recordings to a deliver coolly listenable blend 
of distinctive music that is made equally well for the dance 
floor as well as intelligent listening.
