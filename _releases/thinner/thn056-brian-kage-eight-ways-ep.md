Brian Kage is one uprising talent from Detroit, whose music 
exactly transposes the melancholy, yet somehow optimistic 
feeling of the city he’s living in. Having released 12’’s on 
Beretta and Lumina earlier this year, Brian appreciates the 
idea of releasing music online to attract a larger audience – 
therefore Thinner is the right place to drop his dreamy melodic 
Detroit techhouse choons. With the Eight Ways EP, Brian wrote 
each song about his various travels through life. Each song 
represents vivid memories that have influenced him as a person. 

The idea of change is a big theme with this EP. 

The title song, Eight Ways, is a deep, melodic journey exploring 
the idea of the various paths we come upon in our lives that 
will ultimately alter our future. In Brian’s life, eight always 
seems like a magical number. It likes to appear at the points 
in his life where he feels on the right path. Brian feels that 
there will be eight ultimate paths to take in his life to 
complete his mission. Dennis DeSantis, native Michigan’ aswell, 
reworked Eight Ways (Dennis DeSantis Mix) and gave the song a 
very seducing appeal by adding blissful harmonies and beautifully 
filtered chords. His own careful melodic edits give it a unique 
charming touch.

Laguna is a jazzy little number about achieving one of life's 
many goal. It's like the carefree freedom you experience as you 
finish a big goal, that allows you after accomplishing to make 
your life what you want it be. A lot of this song was influenced 
by sunny days spending at the beach in northern Michigan. Our 
friend Taho from France, owner of Lumina took a chill pill and 
remixed Laguna (Taho Remix). His filtering on the bassline gives 
it a subtle 80’s touch, while the stabs and pads are more 
pulsating and spacey – as the whole remix is put in a wide and 
warm bed with carpets of shining stars around.

With writing Luna Twilight, Brian wrote a song about the power of 
change in our lives that can be so instant, and how we tend to 
take the important things for granted. A long time ago, Brian 
lost a close sibling. He was young, and suffered from the 
darkness & despair. It took many years, to learn to cope but 
meanwhile, while walking under a pitch black northern Michigan 
sky, gazing at the stars, Brian feels the presence protecting him. 
The Luna Twilight (Paul Keeley Remix) is very densely and 
satisfies by transforming and shifting the main pads of the 
original and applying a clicky, yet intense touch.
