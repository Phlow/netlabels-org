Mysterious artist Laura Palmer debuts on Thinner with an EP 
consisting of three main tracks and, as an added luxury, a 
potent remix by Marko Fürstenberg. "Background" seems to be a 
quite contrary title to what you're about to hear on this 
release - Laura Palmer takes the listener into some darkly 
shaded, intoxicating timeless dubtech. All four tracks are 
centered around a dark dub theme and follow a basic pattern 
of an opening dose of minimal dub atmospheres followed shortly 
with the alliance of strong techo beats and bass lines that 
develop their own cosmos and fill the sonic headroom with 
many 3D sounds and effects. 

All of the key elements of dub are present - atmospheric 
layers of static and hiss, punctuated notes, and minor-keyed 
chords loaded with reverb and delay. Intensifying this dub 
ambiance are steady, pounding kick drum beats and intense bass 
notes. Laura Palmer deals with the 2007 techdub topic from a 
more sequential side but still doesn't refuse to experiment 
with breaky beats inside the dubby sparkling cosmos as in 
"Missed". In the end the release sums up to a set of polished 
monumental clubtracks which request to get incorporate in your 
sets. Rush, spatial dubby offbeat sequences, a compact and 
fine functional pressure-laden record that gets crowned by 
the uber-thrusted feature remix of Marko Fürstenberg.
