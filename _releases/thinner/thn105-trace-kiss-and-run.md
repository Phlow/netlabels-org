Trace has left traces indeed from his contribution to THN100 
(the mysterious 'Vicky') and this release just takes on where 
he left. On his thinner debut EP Trace presents three 
conceptual tracks, which are likely to be characterized as 
being 'raw' and/or 'pure', as these tracks are all live 
recordings, no software utilized. Audible groundnoises and 
hissings are part of the concept and load on the 
unflatteringly direct lo-fi aesthetics. 

The opener "Try To Die" is an earthy minimal tripper, which 
builds up slowly and develops misty ties surrounding the core 
pattern structures. Deeply sunken in its own basslines so that 
the bassdrum and the rest of the track barely move the track 
feels as if recorded on  a buzzing cloud of earth moving. The 
second piece "Dream On" has an even more apocalyptic feel, 
with an ambivalent spleen, organs of doom and intruding 
voicesnippets. All of this bubbling melange of acccentuated 
beats and smoldering synths is nicely put to stage and may 
disrupt anytime. 

The title track "Kiss And Run" is built on a simple, yet 
highly effective chord progression, giving a clear direction 
from the start and compiling all the 1996 drama into pure 
energy. The compact beats, which acuminate continously take 
the pattern to new heights. Last but not least we have an 
elusive remix by Zachary Kr√§mer, a new kid on the block who 
remixes "City" and just takes his time to unfold a wonderful 
slow deephouser with earworm qualities. Overall a revitalising 
release for those who remember the past.
