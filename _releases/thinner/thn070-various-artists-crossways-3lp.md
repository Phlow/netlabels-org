Initially the motivation behind our new compilation was to 
build a sequel to the 2003 ‘Silent Season Dub’ compilation – 
to blend warm ambient with minimal dub concepts. But during 
the phasis of collecting tracks we figured that this compi-
lation will turn out more experimental, more rough than than 
the reference. So we decided to put things into a new context, 
that would either underline the variety of concepts but also 
stand for each artists own formular of sound: ‘Crossways’. 

Herein, electronic music with rather minimal rhythmpatterns 
are crossed with spheric ambience, in different moods, 
different slopes and different colours. The listener is able 
to find warm ambient pieces like 'Warm Night Lullaby' by 
Transient or more dubbed out ambience with Zen Savauges 
'Sunken Streetlights'. You can lose yourself in the organic 
cycles of Boris Heizmann's 'Azure' or drift along with 'Scrap 
of Truth' by Selffish. But If you feel like enjoying some 
darker felt material then you'd like to explore the realms of 
Sgnl_Fltr’s chamber dub in 'All Form' by or listening to the 
crickets resting in Kenneth Kirschner’s ‘June 8, 2003 
(excerpt)’. Generally said, if you’re interested in the 
contemporary minimal electronics of 2005 you’ll definately 
find the one or other piece within this compilation that will 
suit you fine.

As the music crosses the flash artwork of this releases does 
so, too –  if you reload the page you’ll figure changing 
background pictures of the cover artwork. The pictures were 
taken in several countries where Joerg (Digitalverein) has 
performed in a Thinner context.  Note that this compilation 
is split into 3 parts, each part about 60 minutes of length. 
If you want to enjoy the compilation mixed then you can down-
load the Crossways Mix by Selffish.
