The long awaited follow up of last years meltdown by Digitalverein
called "Zu Hause²" is here, and its very fresh.

Since the cold winter landscapes of his last album wrapped the
listeners in cold dubs, the new album is more edged into dark and
minimal moods, obviously emotional shapes. Digitalverein keeps
up the crushing intensity he's known for. And surprisingly or not,
it's time to hit down the street with vocals.

Grey days of war news broadcasts, cityscapes over Montréal and
conditions of daily family life are converted into music and the
listener thereby invited to dreaming. Additionally, his detroit
roots are obvious again in certain songs.

If you like the album, go for the special 100 copies limited
cdr available from the Digitalverein homepage. Additionally
you get two bonus tracks.
