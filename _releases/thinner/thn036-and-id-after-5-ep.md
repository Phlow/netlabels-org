And.Id is Andreas Dimitradis from Thessaloniki in sunny Greece. Along with artists like Gabriel Le Mar, reknown from Elektrolux, he released a song on the first labelcompilation on Eraserecords. For Thinner, Andy submitted sunny pumping dubhouse cuts in best Treibstoff Style. Get a cool drink and enjoy the music while it's 75Â° hot outside. And enjoy us even more on this weekends Norberg Festival, where our Showcase takes place with a batch of Thinner/Autoplate artists.
