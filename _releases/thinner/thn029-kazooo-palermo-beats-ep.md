Kazooo might be a familiar name for the people who watch the activities of other netlabels. Yes - he appeared twice on the Ton.Atom netlabel with his "darker side", as he told me. Dark is what we dont want today, so Kazooo hits the jackpot with 4 aces slight off hand with some jazzy-spiced, sneaky minimalhouse cuts. In terms of minimalhouse, pretty filmic i think, especially "Never no and never alltogether" is a surprising track and remarkable moments. Those warm jazzy chords opposed to the raw bassline.
