Mikkel Metal aka Mikkel Meldgaard was born in 1973 in Horsens, 
Denmark and currently lives in the Capital, Copenhagen. Mikkel 
completed a degree in Philosophy at the University of Copenhagen 
in 2001, and today works with web programming and multimedia, 
besides making music. 

Music has ever played a big role in Mikkel’s life, as he’s 
been a guitarist in one of the earliest noise-rock bands in 
Aarhus, Jutland. Equally interested in the introspective sound 
of the British shoe gazer-scene (e.g. Ride, My Bloody Valentine) 
and the looser low-fi aesthetic of some American bands (e.g. 
Pavement, Swirlies) Mikkel was fairly active and tried out 
several band-constellations over a period of years. However, 
after developing interest in electronic music, Mikkel quickly 
changed his musical direction. A sampler was bought and soon 
he started experimenting. 

The first result was a charming 7’’ on the Danish label HAL9000 
in 2000 , which was at the very top of the De:Bug’ magazines 
chart (#42). This one got followed up by further releases on 
the Danish label Echocord, which were very well received within 
the electronic scene. Parallel to this, and taking a slightly 
different path, Mikkel has issued work to German label Kompakt. 

So far this has thrown off two 12’ inches. Still continuing 
click-aesthetic and dub-influence, the beat on these works is 
more 4/4-based, and the production is not quite as dark and 
lo-fi. Mikkels release on Thinner - “Cassini Pieces” - assembles 
music that was produced between 2001-2003. It is a nice showcase 
of earlier works and his production aesthetics. It’s obvious 
how homogenous these works are, as they all move within the 
same approach to electronic dub. 

Especially “Solko” is not a track, it’s a song that perfectly 
reflects Mikkels skills as songwriter. Other tracks, such as 
“Third” and “Abank” slowly move ahead with crisp effects and 
glittering delays. The Off The Sky remix of “Solko” carefully 
decrumbs the original song, to give it an enlightening touch 
with the warm pads and sonar beeps. Lufth remixes “Third” in 
very melting way, where the clean original song liquidly 
floats by. The energetic minimal “Pheno” is slowed down by 
krill.minima, who applies the wah-wah on a rather downbeaty 
construction. Finally, Theodor Zox warms up for his upcoming 
Thinner EP, by transforming the gentle “Abank” into an 
advanced cracking minimalhouse burner.
