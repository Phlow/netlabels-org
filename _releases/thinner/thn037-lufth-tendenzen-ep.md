It was more than time for Thinner to introduce our masterminds Joerg Schuster third project - Lufth. Lufth is Joergs project for warm, organic fluffy advanced electronica apart from the stable 4/4 bassdrum. On THN037 he delivers four exclusive tender scapes with sweet, yet subtle fragments of melodies and dusty steam.
