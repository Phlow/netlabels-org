Nearly a eighteen months ago the German duo Das Kraftfuttermischwerk released their melancholic and romantic virtual long player "Eingang Nach Draußen" on Thinner [THN085] laden with electronic downbeats and dub influences.  A year later their dreamy, minimal-dub track "Flieg mit mir, flieg" appeared on the Thinner compilation "Demo Tracks" [THN091].  Now, in this summer of 2007, Das Kraftfuttermischwerk returns with a soothing, melodic downtempo EP titled "Blüte seines Lebens" - a perfect audio complement to warm, placid days.

Like a carefree boat trip down a meandering, gently flowing waterway on a balmy summer day that ends in the cool shade of a secluded tree-lined beach, this easy-listening four-tracker takes the listener on a tranquil, nostalgic sound journey that includes beautiful synths, pensive melodies, delicate beats, and minimal grooves.  The journey begins with the spacey, delayed synths and drifting atmosphere of "Fluss ins Nichts" which is followed by the dub-tinged title track "Blüte seines Lebens" rich in synthesized melodies and intricate beats.

Passing the halfway mark the tempo slows and the beats become more fragmented with the arrival of "Bluntest in Basel" in which floating keyboard pads and jazzy organ riffs combine to give this track a distant, wistful tenor. Concluding the journey, is the idyllic "Shadows on Wooded Beach" whose blithe keyboards melodies, gliding synths, light beats, and delicate metallic-staccato percussion delivers a lounge-like ambiance.

An enjoyable, mellow mid-summer release for your listening pleasure compliments of Das Kraftfuttermischwerk and netlabel Thinner.
