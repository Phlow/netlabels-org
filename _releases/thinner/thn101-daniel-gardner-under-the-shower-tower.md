It's been a far too long time since the release of Thinner's 
100th and with the downloads accumulating and the break getting 
longer and longer we tried hard in presenting a special release 
that promises to carry on the spirit of where THN100 has left. 

It is with great delight that we may present Daniel Gardner 
a.k.a. Frivolous, who is a somewhat productive exile Canadian 
living in Berlin, accompanied by a chunky remix of Alland 
Byallo, whose recent string of diverse releases proves that 
2008 is a huge year for him and his label Nightlight Music. 

Besides more than 40 releases and over a dozen 12"s to his 
name, Daniel Gardner has toured the globe playing an eclectic 
array of venues and festivals along the way. The album on 
~scape in 2007 was followed by another 12'' in 2008, current 
Vinyl releases are available on Fenou and Minibar. His live 
shows have been hailed for their energy, originality and 
ingenuity as he's taken the stage next to some of the most 
respected names in the business. Never compromising the art 
of showman-ship, these spectacles feature live keyboards and 
vocals as well as the incorporation of his DIY aesthetic. 
Integrating homemade devices such as the "Frivolous Patented 
Electromagnetic knife", the "Broken-Ruler Music Box" and the 
Double "Cable-Tub" Bass, his sets are injected with a sense 
of fantasy, imagination and personality scarcely found 
elsewhere in modern electronic dance music.

From Daniel's perspective, "Under The Shower Tower", is in 
first case an experiment in trying to do something compatible 
with what Daniel considers to be the "typical German format" - 
we get to hear a functional groover, which takes the listener 
on a seductive journey about the joy of body care appreciation, 
expressed by an incremental build up through acid-tinged 
modulations, lasviciously whispered voices and looped slices 
of electroacoustic instruments. And with the song progressing 
over eight minutes it is amazing to feel with what 
somnambulistic certainty Gardner manages to utilize violins as 
messengers of a detached euphoria, putting smile on everybodies 
faces. Indeed it seemed to be successful since it's getting 
praise from the big names, one of them supporters being Jeff 
Samuel, who summarizes the impact of Under A Shower Tower as 
follows: "This track rocks - I've played in every set since I 
received it.  It's worked every time, in big places, small 
places, indoors, outdoors, 3am, 9am, anywhere anytime.  It's 
very rare for something to work that well in so many different 
environments." It is such testimonials which make Under The 
Shower Tower to become a keeper.

The virtual flip sees a remix by San Francisco's most 
sought-after producer Alland Byallo, whose imprint Nightlight 
Music is growing quickly. His compact remix has the floor in 
sight, by keeping things earthy and gradually tweaking filters 
so the sunspots may break out of his synths. Enjoy!
