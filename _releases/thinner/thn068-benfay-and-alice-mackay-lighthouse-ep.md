2005 starts with an rather unusual release for Thinner. Consis-
ting of four gems, the 'Lighthouse EP' is a minimal vocal-house 
EP that might surprise for it's poetic song passages within the 
minimal house frame. This 3-tracker is the result of the first 
collaborative effort of the ever versatile Benfay with the 
irish singer Alice Mackay, currently residing in Scotland. 
Additionally Niels Jensen, one half of the Morris Audio/Trapez 
act 'Dialogue' remixes 'Jump' together with the Zurich DJ Eli 
Verveine. 

Being experienced in working with singers before it wouldn’t 
be asked too much of Benfay to work with a singer in the field 
of minimal house. Having studied the double-bass at the College 
of Music in Berne, Benfay is a creative composer who utilizes 
his many different influences of electronic and acoustic music 
while composing a song. Due to his many projects, ranging from 
clash poetry with Jürg Halter, where he uses to accompany with 
electronics, or the Drum n'Bass liveband 'Foxtrott', Benjamin 
Fay's versatility could never be reduced to one particular 
style. So, opening 2005 for Thinner it would be a good chance 
to walk on some new paths.

The three songs of the “Lighthouse EP” have quite a story. 
Originally it was during Christmas 1999 when Benfay and Alice 
spontaneously recorded her songs in Dublin. Back home in Berne 
the songs got reworked. Alice liked the results but it would 
take another while until Benfay builds these three tracks upon 
her voice, cutting the sequences into parts and giving new 
meaning to them. The project will be continued as Benfay will 
travel to Scotland in February 2005 to record some new songs 
with Alice.
