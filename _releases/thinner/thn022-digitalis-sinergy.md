Already having released on the recommended netlabel 2063music, 
the Duo Digitalis from Bern, Switzerland contribute a smoooth 
4 tracker to Thinner. Each Track evolves huge fx landscapes with 
minimal beats and reduced expressions. Theres much to explore in 
this music, so headphones are definately recommended. This EP is 
calm and a perfect electronica blend with aspects of dub and 
ambience, made perfect for home listening.

"Schwellen" is a heavy subbass mover with pearling Glitterstrings, 
makes you see swimming in a aquarium through cloudily water. A 
Plastikman alike subbass with cold, distant effects and reservedly 
percussion make this track a cold nautic sensual enjoyment. 
"Port.Able" unfolds decent dark and metally soundscapes until a 
downbeat fades in with lovely playing dubby echochords and delays. 
Mysterious voices appear and disappear. "Formicula" comes up with 
sparkling affected chords, a 4/4 bassdrum with closed hihats. The 
syncopic bassline and shuffling hihats grasshop around, the scapes 
sound like ionisated gas outer space. On "Landing" we have aliens 
visiting, this song builds up slowly with a Kleine alike Bassline
and sparse closed hihats, later a tough basskick merges to transform 
this song into a mover until it ends up in a spooky spacey voice 
ambient melange.
