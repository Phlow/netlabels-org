The native Frankfurter Ole Schulte already worked at the 
renowed design office 'Surface' before he started to do music 
by himself. One day Ekkehard Ehlers heard Ole's first demos 
and immediately recognized his potential so he drove him to 
the Force Inc. office the very same day. From this point a 
couple of Veer contributions were put out on Force Inc. until 
his first solo album got released on Move D's Source Records 
in 2002.

Since then Ole intensified researching and sound design and 
started to build up his own studio aswell as he started to work 
with different singers. At that point of time he started to 
work as a designer, particularly for Sven Väths 'Cocoon' Label 
where he's in charge for the website and the record sleeve 
designs. Veer's creative efforts also includes the automobile 
fair in Paris 2004, where he designed a constantly changing 
sound landscape.

Veer's first release after a longer pause is entitled 'Where 
nothing ever happened' and seamlessly continues to the recording 
sessions for his Source Records album entitled 'Lideskape'. 
Within this context the release is meant to be an overlength EP 
of material that homogenously fits well together - it is not 
supposed to be an album. Four of the nine tracks from this 
release are interprations of the core sample material. 
Contributors are Lowfour aka Andreas Tilliander, Geoff White 
and Jacek Sienkiewicz. 

'Where nothing ever happened' carries Veer's thought of diversi-
fication directly into the ear of the listener to spread there 
its wideness and variety. The release begins with 2 large rooms 
full of blissful white ambience where singer and songwriter 
Malte Schlorf (Losoul/Playhouse) is featured on the intro track. 
The concentration of Maltes voice and the blurry soundasthetics 
in 'Präsenz' creates a distinc grade of 'Presence' within the 
room - just as both artists intention of creating music within 
this particular context is to start off without any dictations. 

It is about losing oneself in the process of researching and 
assembling while trying to create a room without any preconditions 
but retaining the very moments of sudden ambience.

With the title track 'Where nothing ever happened' the listener 
dives into a realm of nothing and vast. 'The Path' keeps 
guidance in the 4/4 way with polished deep basslines and subtly 
vanishing effects. The smooth background pads feel like a warm 
coat. 'Vacio' continues the guidance but it more of a metallic 
ambience with a detroit feel, somehow distant and cold, but 
still warm and clean.

Following the four original tracks we have the interpretations 
evolving the construction, each emanating its own fascination by 
falling into place at the same time. The Lowfour interpretations 
feel like sessions, as they originate from the same starting 
point but go entirely different directions, with the first one 
taking the shuffle-exit while the second one is more of a 
scattered 4/4 experiment taking place. Geoff White's inter-
pretation is sort of an unpolished minimal construction that 
incorporates a serene beauty that unfolds during careful 
listening. Jacek Sienkiewicz surprises with a straight and 
crisp dubtech tweezers.
