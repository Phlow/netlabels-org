Following several other previous netlabel appearances, 
Uruguayan audiovisual artist and musician-producer Gastón 
Arévalo makes his debut appearance on netlabel Thinner with 
his new EP of organic grooves, textures, and ambient climates.

Inspired by his aesthetic appeal for nature, topography, 
oceans, and "the algorithmic forms of plants, trees, and 
green landscapes", Gastón describes his four-track "Ultramar" 
EP as an expression of his passion for translating visual 
panoramas and climates "into a digital environment in the 
form of music"  constructed from "impregnated rhythms of 
noises and organic sounds."

Listening to "Ultramar" will reveal a rich, encompassing 
ambiance blending melodies played on conventional instruments 
with crisp grooves, saturated with ambient moods, and infused 
with minimal dub and electroacoustic influences. Each track 
renders a visual scene into the figurative language of music: 
"Ultramar" emulates a seascape of wind and waves while 
"Gourmet" carries with it the laidback atmosphere of an urban 
lounge setting.  "Verona" delivers a spring-like vigor teasing 
the mind with images of leafing trees and rain-fed streams, 
and  "Cinema" continues the organic theme being an edgy, 
grayish song  - an audio portent of an immanent summer 
thunder-shower with billowing clouds and darkening skies.
