Thinner presents the Denmark origined Karsten Hansen on their third release. Three techhouse tracks with dub influences brings the summer vibes for these hot days.

"Sun Spots" starts out with string dots which probably gave the track its name. They last for the whole track and creates a sunny laidback feeling. The groovy techhouse beat, later on shuffled with rides, emphasizes the relaxed flow. "Drift" is a similar easier techhouse stomper with nice groove and the closed hihat shuffles on a slightly distorted bassdrum. The b-side track, "what's dub", is a heavy filtered dubtechno track, with dusty filter sweeps and a cowbell as companion. Strongly up- and downbuilding all the time it erupts like a volcano with a ride who blows to the subtle marching bassdrum. What's dub? - it's really seething.
