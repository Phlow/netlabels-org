Paul Keeley has been writing electronic music for over eight years, 
under various different guises and styles. His first foray into 
musical composition  occurred in earnest at the age of 14, where 
after having owned his first computer, he discovered .MOD files 
and the demo scene surrounding them. There was no turning back. 
As the technology progressed, so did his music, embodying at 
times ambient and melodic atmospheric moods. Since that time, 
Paul has written electronic music under numerous aliases, in-
cluding Silent Q, his IDM-infused melody-driven moniker, and 
Gyges, the experimental abstract atmospheric side of his musical 
character. To help to achieve a sense of musical balance, and to 
preserve his sanity, Paul also played electric guitar with a 
progressive rock band in his hometown, acting as co-songwriter 
and producer for their three recorded albums. After leaving his 
home in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan and living in Montreal for a 
year and a half, Paul developed an acute taste for house music. 

Paul currently lives in Vancouver, BC, where he continues to write 
electronic music of all varieties, yet still focuses on the 
deep and warm glitch-house style he has developed over the past 
year. The “Sussex Blue EP” is a warm blissed-out minimal midnight 
deephouse EP, that comes with four tracks by Paul Keeley and 
additional remixes by Dennis DeSantis, Sean Byrd and Pheek. 
“Sussex Blue” works with cut-up female breathes and reverbed 
spaced-out pads that are put over chilled minimal house beats. 
Far away lighthouse stabs signalize the direction through the 
dusty steam and dense atmospheres. “Lubyu” is a bit more open 
towards the floor, with shuffled hihats over house voice 
frenzys. “Bumper” works with endless synth pads and voice 
fluxes while in the background new pads are shifted up and 
down and finally erupt like lava streams. “Smynk” is the ultimate 
spaced-out minimal house anthem that slow-mos the most unforget-
table moments of neverending nights. Also watch out for the 
stunning remixes by Dennis DeSantis, Sean Byrd and Pheek.
