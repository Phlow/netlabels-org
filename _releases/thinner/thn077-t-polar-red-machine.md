Gary Spence aka T-Polar offers an extra-ordinary richness of 
sound within his universe of Microfunk that is difficult to 
comprehend immediately. Music that is difficult to describe 
even after listening to it multiple times. Somebody who tries 
to stick to a review of T-Polar's music will not get the idea 
of the reviewers description because T-Polar is just something 
else than the usual groovy minimalism one might or might not 
be familar too. Therefore we won't try to describe what's 
waiting for you inside this release - just listen to it and 
figure out by yourself if this one grows upon futher listening 
it or if it's not your cup of tea. Us at Thinner can tell that 
we don't like this album - we just adore it. 

Red Machine is the result of introducing a more organic urban 
inspired sound to the minimal music T-Polar has made in the 
past to give more options, more emotion and reflecting his 
ideas in a slightly more "human" way. "Red Machine" itself is 
the turning point of years of production and the attempt to 
access a more rounded style and incorporate the slightly more 
eclectic tastes which T-Polar has accumulated over the years 
which will be shown in later work as it grows on from this - 
a soundtrack to a lamp light centre of population

T: "If T-Polar's 2004 releases were a bit more obvious 80's 
House the new album has kind of an Arcade funk trademark 
incorporated with the House reminiscences put a bit in the 
background although they are present within the whole album for 
sure. What are the ingredients of the T-Polar universe and what 
do you think are the differences between the 2004 releases 
compared to "Red Machine"?"

G: "I think its just a progression of interests, the previous 
releases I had been very influenced by the Minimal Techno and 
House side of things and decided to make my own twist on that - 
a lot of the elements are still there with Red Machine but 
felt a much wider range of music influencing me and a need to 
make things slightly more human in a way. I would call it a 
mild direction change towards a fuller sound and more interest 
in vocals and how they can affect the feel and arrangement of 
the tracks. Also a desire to keep things original by trying to 
steer clear of a set genre and offer a bit more of what I'm 
really thinking. Melody suddenly got more important."

T: "Once again this is extra-ordinary music that feels somehow 
mystic with it's many layers but also close, groovy and easy 
to access. In other words, they combine distance and proximity. 
Some tracks offer many different perspectives, especially 
"Summer Daize" and "Travellers" sound like colourful 
futuristic downbeat house (or something!) - how would you 
categorize your music and are those pieces more experiments 
through jamming than sequeneced & pre-mapped songs?"

G: "I always have problems categorizing the stuff I make not 
to mention trying to figure out who might be into it and it's 
semi-intentional. Like most people I wouldn't want to be pigeon 
holed and I probably make an effort not to purposely pigeon 
hole myself. As I said, steering clear of obvious genres is a 
must as I don't think it would be the natural results of 
sitting down to make a track unless you were only interested in 
a certain genre or if you decided to make music for DJs. I would 
like people to stop for a second and wonder about the music, 
what makes the producer think this way, where you would begin 
to make it etc as opposed to thinking certain tracks would work 
well in a set or in a club. It's not really intended for 
NightClubs although I hope some of it might work well in that 
setting but I would prefer different associations - odder 
settings - maybe more personal to the individual than just 
something to dance to then dispose of. The slight extra human 
touch maybe comes from the jamming as you mention - not 
sequencing everything to perfect mathematics or being over 
technical in certain departments - improvising to a certain 
extent and almost programming some elements to improvise by 
themselves."

T: "I guess the track "Red Machine" is the main track of the 
album - this one once again combines alien funk with this 
unreal soft pads with this particular ethereal melody and 
groovy slow motion house rhythms. What is your association 
with this track, can you describe what makes the Red Machine 
here?"

G: "This is probably the most important piece of the album to 
me and the real cornerstone in interests. It was originally 
intended to have full vocals over it and be a bit more of an 
electronic funk track but I wasn't able to do that at the 
time - but it definately is a vision of the future for me and 
a strong sign of where I've been since and am looking to go 
back to. It's more about the melodies than most previous 
music I've made and I'm pretty pleased with it - it's got a 
slight element of joy to it but an underlying sadness. I would 
also hope my sense of humour comes through in some of the 
music but it may be too deeply buried. It's there somewhere I 
promise."
