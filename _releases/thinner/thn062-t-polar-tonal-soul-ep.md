2004 has been the most prolific year of Belfasts’ Gary Spence 
aka T-Polar so far – something set him on fire, and we’re proud 
to be part of it. His releases on Morris Audio Citysport and 
the Substatic Sublabel Karloff, aswell as the incredible 
“Boobcube EP” on Epsilonlab set new benchmarks in terms of 
versatility within the more minimal settings of Housemusic. 

Being guest on Thinner on THN050 (w/ Clive Kells), collecting
6000 downloads since January and recently remixing Benfay with 
a superb Klackerhouse tune, T-Polar presents a delightful four-
tracker, whose title “Tonal Soul” couldn’t better describe the 
feeling of those four songs. 

The starter “Global Animal Dub” starts with glassy pads and 
mincing percussions. Within 2 minutes T-Polar manages to create 
a totally mixed up setting that carries elements from 80’s 
Chicago funk, late night essential deephouse and top-recent 
minimal house tendencies, all somehow mixed and splattered, but 
also somehow so much arranged precisely. “Slugs” is a flat mystic 
minimal tunnel of splitting beats, twisted voices and shattered, 
twirling effects that are set on run-stop-restore. The title cut 
“Tonal Soul” comes up with a warm detroity pad we’ve been all 
waiting for, passed-out voices within a bed of microfunk textures 
and shifting percussive portions and a static doodling bassline. 
Again everything so unusual and on first sight so chaotic, but 
in between timeless seductive in it’s sensuality. “Wracket 
Shield Fleet” is a hymn that underlines everything this EP is 
about with damped unfolding groovey basslines over bleepy 
chiptune (!) spots and silly voices snippets. A very strange, 
but immensely initimate melange of pixeled house stabs and deep 
filtered funk shiftings, that leave the listener with a big 
exclamation mark to watch out for the next releases of this guy.
