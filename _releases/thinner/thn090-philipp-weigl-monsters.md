Fitting naturally into the autumn mood and reflecting the 
satisfying warmth of a relaxing evening at home,  the Munich-
based electronic music artist Philipp Weigl brings his first 
album to Thinner following the release of “Silently Moving” 
on Legego one year ago. “Monsters” is influenced mostly by 
the music of Björk, Portishead, and Radiohead along with the 
lyrics of Nick Cave and, in a minimal way, by his studies of 
classical piano at the University of Music and Performing Arts 
in Munich.  

“Monsters” is about music and lyrics. They emerge independent 
of and unconnected with one another only to meet for a 
conjoined dance.  The music and lyrics are deferential of one 
another with the music coming out of a creative void and the 
lyrics being formed by a blend of experiences, dreams, 
fantasies, and memories. Spoken in a low, whispered voice, 
the lyrics do not rise above the music, but drift just below 
the surface making their presence known without being 
intrusive. At the same time, the music intensifies the 
predominantly subtle character of the lyrics in order to 
reveal the fine humor, irony, and emotion hiding within them 
but without affecting them too hard. The resulting sounds are 
at once melancholic and dark but also harmonious and warm.

Listening to the songs on the album creates a feeling much 
like one gets during sleep as our dreams reappraise the day’s 
experiences. Immediately awakened from a dream every part of 
it can be recalled and each nuance can be experienced and 
seen with the inner eye as a phantasmagoric slideshow of 
continuous images. Slightly disoriented,  we ask ourselves - 
was this real or was it a dream? As the day progress and our 
memories degrade with the passage of time, details of the 
dream fade away and only vague fragments remain like a 
collection of disjointed snapshots.

The eight songs on “Monsters” describe pictures of daily life 
from the viewpoint of a dream with emotions ranging from 
slightly unsettling to wistful. For example, listening to 
“Unrelated” we hear, “I found a letter in my bag that was 
written in a language that I don’t understand.“ Philipp 
translates this into the disconcerting feeling that there 
seem to be events in life that are completely incomprehensible 
to the individual person while at the same time appearing to 
be understood by everyone else. On the other hand, the mood 
turns melancholic and nostalgic on “Lifted” as we hear the 
dreamy juxtapositions of unconnected sentences: “I’m lying on 
my back and I’m watching fireworks.” - “I’d like to dance 
like the others do.” -  I can hear the distant laughing 
fleeting away.”

Listening to this album is just like waking up from a dream.  
We ask ourselves the question whether the lyrics are really 
so full of secrets and mystery or is this just an illusion,  
and are they merely dealing with the small problems and 
occurrences of everyday life?
