Nulleins aka Markus Dolic delivers another superb atmospheric dubhouse-with-trance-elements (!) release called "Freeway EP". Full of phased chords, delayed glimmer stabs, lights and dark blue coloured, this release is intended to get listened to while driving cabrio car, as the tracktitles say. "Departure" starts with subtle mellow phased chords until the out run starts with a heavy flat kickdrum. With a heavy taste of acid, "Sunset" works best at sunrise when the first sunspots arise to tweak your feelings. Heavy resonance-tranced blurry break in the middle of the track. Might also guide you through tubes and tunnels. Strong kick and delayed dubstabs on "Cruise" which evolves suspiciously hit-potential. A big wave to ride on. "Last Exit" is pure mellowness on portamento touches, very cloudy: last exit to heaven - or infinity?
