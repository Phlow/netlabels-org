Finally we release a new ep again! We signed an uprising talent from Switzerland called Benfay for two eps and this is his debut called "Carbon EP".

3 cuts with lots of different flavours inside: moody modulated house organs, deep basslines and atmospheric filterworks aswell as clicky effectpaintings merged with shuffled banging kickdrums. If you are into the sound of the Kanzleramt label this is a definitive checkout!
