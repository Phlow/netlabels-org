After his looming contribution on the "Silent Season Dub" 
compilation it's time for Chronolux to represent himself with a 
proper own release on Thinner. Chronolux is none other than Dave 
Ellesmere, whose critically highly acclaimed full length "Angry 
Young Computer" was released on Kanzleramt in July. Ellesmere 
himself can look back on a music career lasting for almost 20 
years. Being active in the 80â€™s as drummer of a couple of 
punkbands like "The Insane" or "Doctor & The Crippens", for Thinner 
Dave releases a pleasing Detroit-inspired Dubtechno EP. 

The opener "Refraction" is a catchy Dubtech Clubber that may have 
been very well a song of Daves sideproject Shapes & Forms, which 
is him together with Diego. The second piece, "Returning", is more 
of minimal pressure, and might be an appealing tool for the MP3-DJs. 
The metallic harmonious and robotic "Sun Spots" leaves traces in the 
filings, while afterwards Chronolux disappears within a sizzling 
cloud of dubs with track "004". 

He will be back again - at the latest in January when he will 
tour across Germany for a couple of Livegigs as part of the 
Kanzleramt 10 year anniversary.
