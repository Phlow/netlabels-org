If you ever happen to visit Montreal one day and by times 
decide to go to a restaurant to have a good meal you might 
unwittingly enter the realm of one of Montreal’s most secret 
musicians. At this particular place there’s a good chance that 
the music surrounding you is Thinner and the creator of your 
meal is nobody else than Jean-Sébastien Roux aka deluge. 
Jean-Sébastien is not only creative behind the kitchen stove - 
after work he keeps being immersed in his work, but then it’s 
in front of his computer with headphones on.

"Creating music is always dragging me deep into something I 
don’t really handle; I like being tranported by the music and 
feel the abandon of creation. The reason why I create 'deluge' 
apart of 'tlon' is for this simple reason: tlon is my 
experimentation aspect, and deluge is my playful aspect. It’s 
like reading a book by Deleuze and then reading a Marvel comic, 
it's about different moods and catching the train within. My 
new album ‘The Metapop complex’ is the result of an interior 
battle between mentality and body language." If last years 
first deluge release on Thinner called “Departure in 
affection …” would be painted in soft orange then the new 
album “The Metapop complex” is painted into blurry blue. But 
how could that transition in colours being explained? 

After “Departure in affection …” Jean-Sébastien tried to focus 
on doing more accessable, clubby tracks that would be easier 
to get into. From this point of composition the “Metapop EP” 
arised, whose 4 tracks now form the basis of this conherent 
and homogene new album by one of Montreal's most reclusive 
musicians. Since Jean-Sébastien is more sort of the bedroom 
producer trying to find the sound behind the sound his current 
state of mind allowed to expand the existing EP into an LP 
while keeping the context. 

Hereby, the title can be read as a division, or a certain level 
of creation, to search for non-mental music. Why a complex? 
Roux considers his music to be straight to the point, always 
subtle but yet intense. There is something brave and profound 
in the sound, that is like transposing a kid's dream about 
being a Superhero and saving people in music, just like in a 
Marvel comic.

Soundslike, this album works with many analogue-tinged elements 
that reminiscent to the mid-90s sound aesthetics, a certain 
level of technology that has almost died-out since most 
releases of today link to the most current dsp-plugins 
available. After Kraftwerk, Depeche Mode and similar bands, 
Roux's total immersion into electronic music has been mostly 
accomplished with the Warp catalogue, Transmat and the 
essential Detroit stuff. And that's exactly with the idea of 
deluge with the Metapop Complex, a less sparkling and more 
direct sound. "I may want this project be an open mind creator, 
in opposition with tlon who's really into soundscape and 
research and intensity. Tlon looks inside - deluge looks 
outside."
