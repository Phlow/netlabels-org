"Nitron" is the true followup of Benfays "Carbon" EP which was 
THN007 ... 3 tough compressed banging techno tracks with chord 
shuffles, glueing stabs and wide rooms. All 3 tracks unfold their 
groove best during the night in the club, so if you're from 
Switzerland you shouldnt miss Benfay when hes performing live 
in Berns clubs and bars with his laptop and audiosetup cause he 
only plays music from the net, including much Thinner and 
Rohformat material! A new EP from him for Thinner is already in 
the plannings. 

1. One In A Million
2. Rheas Blues
3. Time Test
