Thinner number seventy-six brings you the ever diligent Pheek
from Montr√©al with a collection of tracks that have been 
produced over the past 2.5 years. Two of those tracks have 
been produced with Benfay according to JPs stay at his place 
back in 2002, during his first european tour. The original 
track "Dub Trail" sees a remix by T-Polar, with whom Pheek 
played in Belfast early April. Other cooperational tracks with 
Jason Corder are on their way to end up with a CD release under 
the project belt "Social System", so Pheek's many project 
involvements reveal that a major part of his musical life is 
all about consortium! Speaking about, the latter project with 
Jason Corder recently saw their live debut on the Mutek Festival.

However, the tracks included on this EP are a bit older of 
date and gently reflect the time for when Pheek predominantely 
worked with pads in his minimal environments. Due to his 
involvement with hardware labels he lately produced more 
functional, more reduced stuff. But releasing these tracks that
have been produced 2002-2004 reflect a time where Pheek has 
successfully started to get himself establish in the guild of 
the prolific cutting edge minimal producers, introducing a 
very own style, constructing variable minimal tracks with 
punching hi-pass bassdrums and mostly eerie effects. So, 
Consortium somehow closes the circle.

In March 2005 after finding his own outlet Archipel and 
numerous releases both on netlabels and hardware labels in 
the meantime, Pheek returned to play a healthy amount of gigs 
in the U.K. and Germany but also to find out about how 
recognition over here is going: "There's two things that were 
getting very important to me as I was travelling: I wanted to 
see what was the importance of Netlabels in the club scene and 
also, I wanted to see what is status of the minimal scene as 
well. I was pretty happy to realize that both are very well 
established and very healthy, but still small. I was very 
impressed how much people came to me because I was on various 
netlabels. Even though I was released on Minus or Contexterrior, 
I was thinking people would come to see me for that, but it 
was actually because I was one of the active netlabel producer 
at the moment. I also realised that people who are into net-
labels are very knowledgeble, know a lot about music and are 
extremely passionate to get the latest thing available. That's 
very refreshing to see we're not working for nothing. From 
what I experienced, the vinyl releases seemed to give me a 
lot of credibility for DJs as for the netreleases got me a 
lot of supporters from people who love to browse and search 
for music online."

Having said that, the tour went pretty well and Pheek used 
the time for extensive networking, so he brought a lot of
impressions back home to Canada: "I think meeting a lot of 
people in Europe made me feel like moving there as well. This 
is something that a few american artists did and I'm getting 
there. Somehow, I feel a bit isolated from a distant scene in 
which I feel I have a place and where I'm appreciated more 
than where I come from. We'll see by the end of the summer."

Being active in the music biz since many years now Pheek 
knows very well that the road to success is a long and windy 
one. We'll indeed see what happens but one thing for sure - Pheek
carefully watches developments taking place and will take the 
right decision. Whereever he will decide to stay.
