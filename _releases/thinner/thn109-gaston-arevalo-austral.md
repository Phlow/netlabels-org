"austral" is the second thinner release by uruguayian artist 
gastón arévalo, packed with smoothly gliding tracks which 
oscillate above the ground. following on his thinner debut 
"ultramar", which resulted in several gigs in europe, his new 
ep further refines the cloudy minimalism arévalo aims for. 
this time he matures his sound and enters dense harmonic 
spaces with withdrawingly, yet reluctant smooth tracks, which 
are highly euphoric and magic in their own sense. shining 
through is deep minimalism, affection to melodies and earthy 
beats, all sounding like light. 

the release opens with the self titled track, which is 
enclosed by a harmonic pad, framing in the sunspots in a 
body of minimal grooves. with the second and third tracks 
"dubois" and "insular" arévalo takes the listener into a 
sonic rainforest, where bustling humid micronisms crack on 
the grounds. the accumulated dense sequences add a streamlined 
imagery to the sounds, with plenty of rest which glow from the 
inside out, and work on the dance floor more than ever, 
provided it exists in your dreams. 

the final track "relief" is more untangled and gives room for 
sublime pads, which slowly search for the perfect grooves 
within conclusive structuring sound experiments. arévalo 
somehow manages to catch his vision of organic minimalism, 
which doesn't orient towards the old masters, but 
nevertheless reaches similar depth. music which lasts for the 
change of the coming summers.
