After Thinner’s summer holidays we welcome the next batch of 
Thinner releases with a remix compilation for Benfays versatile 
warm summer breezed ambient/lounge/dubhouse album “One Touch 
Button Music”. Since Benfay is a long time Thinner artist and 
had presented a playful and decent album in April, we felt it 
would become an exciting experience to ask our artists for 
their point of view. 

This result “One Touch Button Remixes” is a compilation that 
features reinterpretations of the most wanted Thinner artists 
in between multiple genres of modern electronic music the 
original album provided. 

Mikkel Metal, recently showing up with a new 12’’ on Kompakt, 
opens up with a sticky chemical interlude of “Elfenblond”, 
that loses the downbeats and creates glueing lava textures 
out of the sensitive original sounds. 

Thinner’s Joerg Schuster, aka Digitalverein, prepared a 
melange of the mellow ingredients “Segelflieger” provided, 
utilizing tricky dub beats instead of the linear programming 
of the original, while Joerg being Lufth did a deeply 
filtered mix with stargazing dub chords and lush snaredrums. 
The easy-listening “Allein Unter Den Arkaden” received a 
concentrated transition by krill.minima, keeping the mellow 
emotionality of the original by directing the attention to 
the fragile riding cymbals and carefully placed fading melody
dots. 

Paul Keeley felt inspired enough to do two totally different 
remixes for “The Carribean Bar”, proving the diversity of the 
original material. His “Wet Coast Mix” is a shallow and 
soothing downbeat jam, while the “Starlight” mix features the 
clicky midnight deephouse spheres we use to get seduced by 
Paul. The fairytale “Jack And Jill” seemed to be perfect source
material for Thinner’s lounge specialist Selffish, whose 
reinterpretation turned out more dashing and windy in relation 
to Benfays work. 

The steamy “Oak” received a Pheek treatment, whose beats are 
more earthy, with clever shifting beats and rattling percussions. 
“Blüten-Konfetti” got reworked by TPolar, whose splatter houze 
bonus beats are foreground shaking, with the original pads 
fading over in the background . 

Jason Corder, with his recent Thinner album in the backpack, 
did a stunning microhouse cut of “Flussbett”, with californic 
filter sweeps and easy dubs. And our old friend from Switzer-
land, Niels Jensen, gave the subtle “Bluestone” his unique 
uplifting, yet carefully arranged pattern twist that shines 
through his hardware production methods. The remixes by Dennis
DeSantis and Mateo Murphy turned out floorfilling, concrete 
and late night essential tools.
