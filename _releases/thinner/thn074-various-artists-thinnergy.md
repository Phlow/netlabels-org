Finally we're proud to present the longawaited cooperation 
release with the fine spanish Sinergy Networks Label. Before
we continue with the (usual) release description, some words 
about Sinergy. 

Sinergy Networks is a netlabel managed by Luiz Ortiz / L.O.D. 
who got socialized with electronic music being 17, working 
in Ireland setting up sound systems at different venues. Being 
a passioned music lover, Luiz found the Vinyl/CD Label 
'Klitekture' 2001 in Gran Canaria. Klitekture has meanwhile had
releases by Sutekh, Mikael Stavostrand and Deadbeat amongst 
other split EPs. In addition to 'Klitekture', the netlabel 
Sinergy Networks was created early 2003 to experiment a bit 
more on electronic music, applying the theory of sinerism to 
music production. 

Current Sinergy Artists are Funzion, Gurtz, Abstract Groove, 
Pep Gaya, Franco Cinelli or Tupperwear. Altogether, the label 
has been very active the past months by doing new releases in 
a rhythm of 2 weeks, providing damn nice releases related to 
minimal house/techno. Thinner and Sinergy Networks share 
similar circles of interest regarding certain types of music,
so we thought of getting together, becoming allies.

So, for this special occassion, we present four artists known
from their Sinergy releases and have four thinner artists 
doing remixes. According to this release, there is a pendant
release on Sinergy-networks.com (SN021), that features those 
four thinner artists with their own tracks, remixed by Sinergy 
artists! Go download! - but first take a listen to this 
package, providing 8 new tracks!

Bern from Lille, France, who has recorded 12''s for the 
cologne based Traum Label starts off with the (maybe) most
reduced track ever released on Thinner (it's similar reduced 
as Thomas Jaldemark's 'Highway Patrol' from THN001!). If you
listen carefully you'll find many mini-bleeps, crackles & pops
spraying like a campfire during darkness, forming an 
abstract rhythmic building. We thought that Bern's song could
need a Pheek treatment aside Thinner's, so there goes his 
Acid mix, that sounds like a breeding mixture of organic 
chemical ingredients getting stired in a huge metallic bowl. 

'Minerva' by Funzion is a classic floating minimal dubhouse
tune like we haven't had it in a while on Thinner. Consisting
of a few functional elements you're easily put to seesawing.
The remix of Theodor Zox is more complex and crisp in detail,
cutting off the hook melody however keeping the tonal 
sequence. Nice! 

Next up is Gurtz from Buenos Aires, a promising talent and 
also an artist who has been in the focus recently with 
releases on Stadtgruen and a compilation track for Clevermusic. 
'Klok' from Gurtz sounds like the pure summer, mellow pads 
combined with warmth and minimal rythmic details that feel 
like a sunrise. Smoothness! So let's hear the starbreezing 
transformation of secret agent deluge from Montreal. He truely
sequenced a profound shimmering gem of glitter pads and 
sparkling effects that dive within the warm spaces Gurtz
original track has left! 

Last but not least we have the contribution 'Sol' by Luiz 
Ortiz himself aka L.O.D. with the Marko FÃ¼rstenberg remix, a 
solid dubhouse icon. While L.O.D. balances his mix out, 
Marko's version is a little more straight, securely 
persecuting the flow of the original track.
