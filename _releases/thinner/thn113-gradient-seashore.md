We're kicking off the autumn season with a free ep by the 
uprising russian producer Gradient, who presents three classic 
minimal dub tracks tailored for thinner, focusing on grooves 
and kicking it gently. 'Changes' comes with a start-stop 
groove and paints pliant dub chords over a gradually shifting 
theme. On the second track 'Deep Performance' Gradient sinks 
more and more in the wideness between clean dry beats, a 
discreet shifting bassline and the idea of a timeless groove, 
giving mood to the whole scenario, similar to what vocal 
cutups represent in deephouse tracks, whose indefiniteness 
just is their argument and which transports something like 
cavity and closeness. Very beautiful and floating endlessly. 
The third track 'Seashore' loves the chords borrowed from the 
dub tracks, but takes care of everything else than the 
dancefloor, it's a friendly and sinister track at the same 
time which comes very close to oneself. Martin Jarl, who will 
soon enough have a new album out on thinner, takes on to 
remix 'Deep Performance' and gives it an entirely new detroit 
scope, enthusiastic and concentrated at the same time, as his 
mix is warm, slack but for all that full of vision.
