  <description>FLOW.ERS (SUTEMOS008)

What is the biggest expression of love to music like? Actually this question is a retorical one ant cannot be answered. But I try to reveal it. What is love, after all? Love means attention. This time I give away myself to music. The word _MINE_ is far more imporant here than in any other sentence because it is insanely close and deep. It is really hard to tell how big is the pleasure to have your own personal compilation. And the pleasure is even bigger because it is just as I wanted it to be. Flow.ers is the music that I grew up with and with it I still continue growing. It is the music of my love...

In loving memory of Gytis. RIP.</description>
