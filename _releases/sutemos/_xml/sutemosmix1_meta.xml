DJ Walkman is one of the most active persons on the Lithuanian electronic scene. He is mostly known for being founder and runner of this gorgeous web site and net label (sutemos.net that is). He is also a host of Sutemos Live gig series. By breaking stereotypes of one-day projects Sutemos web site has become a symbol of idm and minimal music not only in Lithuania but also abroad. Our releases are warmly met in Japan, USA and Western Europe.

This has opened the door for DJ Walkman to the biggest contemporary music parties. Although he has been collecting records for more than 9 years already, he started mixing only in 2005. His versatile and wide taste and thousands of idm, minimal, trip hop, house, glitch, techno, drill'n'bass and etc. records lets DJ Walkman during the play be whatever he wants to be.

From 2005 he has been spinning records together with the legend of chicago House - Johny Fiasco, Nightwares On Wax, Fluxion, Technical Itch, Rhythm &amp; Sound. He was also hosting and warming up in Sutemos Live event series such producers as Modeselektor, Apparat, Plaid, Monolake, SCSI9, Vladislav Delay, Michael Fakesch (ex Funkstorung), Thomas Fehlmann, Deabeat, Donnacha Costello, Stewart Walker, Jan Jelinek, Anders Ilar, Yagya and Sleepy Town Manufacture.

The idea behind Milk Und Herring is really simple and well reflected in its title - to connect things that seem to be inconsistent from the first glance. And to do this as good as possible. because there is nothing worse than a monotonic mix that makes the listener die out of boredom. Enjoy!</notes>
