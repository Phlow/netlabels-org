  <title>Red, Green, Blue &amp; Other Summer Feelings</title>
  <description>This summer we release yet one more Sutemos compilation. This time it will be different from the previous ones. Full of summer's evening beauty Red, Green, Blue &amp; Other Summer Feelings will be dedicated to something that can be named as a soft mixture of post/indie rock, instrumental, synth, ambient music with a sprinkle of electronic experiments. Additionally, almost all tracks will be featured by vocals. The works on this compilation started last autumn. From the very beginning we tried to concentrate on esthetics and beauty, not names. No numbers, no facts, no data - just pure and gorgeous beauty. This summery sad and longing compilation will feature artworks from a little fairy No_joy that will be filled with sincerity, tenderness and calmness</description>
