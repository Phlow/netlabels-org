  <title>Shovel And Cava (Sutemos024)</title>
  <description>Amish 82 is an unpretentious elektro/house duo based in Trondheim, Norway. Percussionist/programmer JÃ¸rgen Meyer and keyboardist/programmer Snorre Valen is the core of the project-based group, and they often hire guest artists to contribute with vocals, guitars and other instruments, both for recordings and their regular live gigs. 

"Shovels And Cava" is the result of one year of experimenting. The mini-album combines layers of genres, and showcases the contrasts between minimalist and dry house beats on one hand, and baroque arrangements on the other. It is Amish 82's first regular release"</description>
