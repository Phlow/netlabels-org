  <title>Various Artists - Intelligent Toys 4 (Sutemos019)</title>
  <description>So here it is - long awaited and much anticipated fourth volume of our Intelligent Toys.
After releasing each part of this series we don't know whether we are going to make another one. Simply because it seems that we can't beat it. But then we do. Again and again. And we still don't know if we going to make another one. For the same reason.

This time we prepared almost two and half hours of gorgeous music. We won't discuss any of the artists because you know them really well already (and if you don't we'll leave the joy of discovery for you). As usual, we recommend you playing around and choosing the right toys for your mood, your character and weather in your city.

Much has been said before. Much will be left unsaid.
It's listening time now.
