This compilation is our real toy. The idea to compile it was born even before the appearance of sutemos.net. But we had to make a long way, to create our own face, to gather contacts, to become interesting abroad. A more than year long work is finally finished and it is all hidden deep inside the intelligent toy. It was worth waiting.

February 29th. The date - compilation was released ? is as rare and uncommon as the compilation is for us. Now we can boast that we gathered a bunch of IDM stars which present a number of previously unreleased tracks. We did not try to prove anything to anyone or to race anybody. Compilation's concept is the same as the concept of the site ? all that we like.

Intelligent Toys are acompanied by a virtual collection of visual art. It was especially made for the Intelligent Toys. Authors of various photos/manipulations were creating art that reflects a doll/toy/child theme. Those works are like a body part of the compilation for they complete the music and fill in the empty toy making it orbicular.
