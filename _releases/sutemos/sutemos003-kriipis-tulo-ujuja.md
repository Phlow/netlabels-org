In the beginning of 2002 Kriipis Tulo completed an EP entitled Ujuja (in Estonian language it stands for swimming). The feeling of soaking in warm and soft water in a swimming pool where two young people - a boy and a girl - meet each other runs through all 7 tracks of Ujuja. Sympathizing each other at the first sight they fall in love and enjoy each other staying together. Everything takes place here - in the swimming pool where unceasing murmur of the water runs through the romanticism and tenderness of Hommikune Ujuja track and happy-go-lucky time carelessly spent beside the soda pop machine in Paane Ujuja. Finally, complete dissolution in the water and each other - One Ujuja.

Ujuja is the script of the movie that was never filmed. It is a dream... only a beautiful dream...
