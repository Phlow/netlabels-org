The Snowglobe EP is the first beat-driven output for a while for Maps and Diagrams, having been on an ambient-acoustic kosmiche journey for the past few years busy creating textural soundscapes and drone work. Tim Diagram would like to thank the remix artists for giving their individual interpretations on the songs.
