Draumar Um Kalt Sumar - in a wonderful Icelandic language means Dreams About Cold Summer. If to be sincere we don't really know why we are dreaming about cold summer...It might be because it is unusual but still very beautiful - same as Iceland itself. In spite of the fact that none of us has ever been to Iceland we are felling unaccountable admiration towards this small, cold and mean island. We are so crazy about it that we even decided to dedicate our latest release to it. That is why its name is in Icelandic language (thanks to Steini). That is why its gallery is full of exceptional Icelandic scenery. That is why this music is full of those feelings that will tell you about this wonderland. About its clear, cold sky and unordinary lines of its landscape. We want to sincerely thank all of you who helped us in turning this idea into a little miracle. We also would like to thank all of you who were not afraid of waiting for so long.

We hope that you will feel like standing under the cold sky of Iceland at least for a moment while listening to this compilation. That would be more than enough for us...
