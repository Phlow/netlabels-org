stockfinster is from Malmö, Sweden and consists mainly of batti who writes, plays, arranges and mixes everything and sometimes with a little help from his musical friends. stockfinster was once a band with real instruments and vocals but after a long period of playing in a stuffy rehearsal-room, the tension became too strong and the band split.

Everybody went on to pursue their musical aspirations, and batti kept the name of stockfinster for his own electronical soundscapes. batti himself is a sound-engineer/producer and co-owner of the recording studio Gula Studion in MalmÃ¶. Every now and then the two worlds merge and a lot of his songs have shifted many times between the analogue platform of Gula Studion and the experimental software in battiÂs home.

Even though stockfinster has been around for quite some time, and has been rather productive, nothing has ever been released or even submitted to any labels. We were happy enough to be the first who heard stockfinster's music.

This is what stockfinster himself tells about All Becomes Music:

»For many years my music was my own personal business - something which I
shared only with my closest friends. I liked it this way, because it was a
safe and easy way of making sure that my music was heard only by people that
I knew shared my taste. Although people who heard it seemed to like it a
lot, I didn't listen to them. I was too busy doubting my abilities and my
sounds.

One day a friend was raving about a Russian act called Novel 23. In my
search across the internet I found Sutemos. At first I wasn't to intrigued
by the site, suspicious that everything on it was free. However, I
downloaded a couple of tracks and liked it, so before long I had downloaded
everything on the site. To my surprise it was high quality stuff. I was
amazed. Most acts were unknown and unestablished, much like myself. In a
sudden rush of confidence I sent an e-mail to the guys running the site,
asking if they were interested in hearing my tracks. They were kind enough
to include two of my tracks on the Red, Green, Blue And Other Summer
feelings-compilation.

   Now the time has come to release a full album (or whatever you'd like to
call it) on Sutemos. Ten stockfinster-tracks that cover the last couple of
years. I feel a bit strange about it all, because I am not used to having my
music accessible to the general public. Each track is very much a labour of
love, with many hours of nitpicking behind them. I hope whoever downloads
them listens to them carefully at least once - preferably on headphones. A
lot of the tracks include samples of voices that I have gathered from TV and
movies. I often receive critique that there are too many of them, and that
the songs would be better off without them. Although I donÂt agree, I have
tried to steer away from resorting to voice-samples in my more recent songs.
The samples on these tracks are all an integral part of the songs, and
should be viewed as the equivalent to normal vocals. I hope they are
intelligible. Lastly, I have to send out some love to Helena (for all the wonderful voices), Ola (for all the help with mastering), Jonas (for all the basses and vocals), Markus (for the piano on dismantled and last but not least, the fold (for writing the melody for duel).«

This is possibly the most sincere release on Sutemos which every note, every moment is pulsating with the human touch, with love and simplicity. We hope that All Becomes Music will be your faithful friend during calm and cozy autumn evenings.



## Notes

All Becomes Music was originally intended as an ambient track with no drums at all. It was because of the wonderful vocal melody supplied by good friend Helena Josefsson that the song took off in another direction. Wonderful feelings above the heart.

A Crack In Time is featuring the vocal and bass guitar of stockfinsterÂs former bassplayer Jonas Hult.
