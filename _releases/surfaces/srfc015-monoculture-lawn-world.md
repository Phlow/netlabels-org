'lawn world' by monoculture is surfaces' second northamerican release. this work is highly eclectic - easy synthetic melodies are interlaced with clicky rhythms, followed by low drones, oriental ambience, guitar and piano sounds, among other. all together these elements form an imaginative and complex (almost) easy listening work that is between the territories of particular styles. with its gradation of tones and moods, this album tells a story with unexpected turns
