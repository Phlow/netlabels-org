after a summer pause surfaces returns with a release that adds some summer variety to its catalogue. this time it's a warm electro-/indie-pop ep by fingus, who was featured on srfc001 va -- surfaces. the mood of this work is intimate and slightly melancholic, thus this release is perfect for midsummer daydreaming

this release will surely be a bit of a trick for the non-lithuanian listeners. all track titles and spoken word lyrics on 'eskizas:rytas' are in lithuanian, which might add an exotic touch for those unfamiliar with this language. the music itself, however, is guaranteed to be internationally comprehensible. a quick note: the third track, 'svajone', also has lyrics, but they are not voiced... so imagine that you know them and try to repeat as they go

the author himself wants to acknowledge the people whose input to this work is very valuable: ema and rutt (for lyrics behind 'eskizas:rytas' and 'svajone'), sharunas chepulis (for voice on 'eskizas:rytas') and tikrastigras for cover design

this ep is meant to be recorded onto a mini cd, so the cd cover is made in that format
