v/a -- surfaces is the first release of surfaces netlabel. it features selected tracks of 10 talented lithuanian electronic composers

styles cover the whole range of weird leftfield electronica, from experimental noise to melodic clicks'n'cuts

most of the artists did not previously release their music commercially and are open to new ideas + experiments. v/a -- surfaces is a perfect sampler of the various musical and cultural surfaces that the artists explore
