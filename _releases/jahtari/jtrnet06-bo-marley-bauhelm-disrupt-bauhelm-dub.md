BAUHELM is the title of our new NET-7Ã‚ number 06 coming from BO MARLEY. The ones of you who speak German will wonder at the marvellous twists and turns that beautiful tongue can take when it gets into the crazy tape loops of the BO MARLEY universe, where Dub is transmitted as voltage and Reggae roots have the form of an analogue-synth cable patch bay!

The A-Side is an absolute eardriller with unforgettable refrain and all-over poetic lyrics that will puzzle you for weeks! The ultra-heavy riddim comes along with a great horn section, pumping bassline and smashing drums, all roasted between analogue synth modules in high current mode. On the B-Side the Dub version kicks in with full delay force over an even deeper bass. Horns and vocals get caught in several filterboxes while the rest explodes off to outa space.

Our first vocal release, by the way! Stay tuned for more!
