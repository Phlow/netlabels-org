A smashing ChipDub-Ska-EP coming here from the ATARI tracker legend Dubmood. Six tracks full of love for the rough Ska classics of old, bursting with sheer virtousity and an obession for funky details. A sure winner full of hits, this grooving beauty is bound to make you dance while grinning from ear to ear.

The EP starts off with a great version of the Skatalites-classic "Exodus" (who in turn took the theme from E. Gold's oscar winning movie score), followed up by a fine Liberators-cover. A top "Monkey Island" dub, featuring the legendary title theme by Michael Z. Land, is around too. The Maytals' "Pressure Drop", later covered by punk-rocker icons The Clash (among others), is followed by the highly addictive "VodSka-Dance", featuring some popular Russian folk lore. Most notably the alltime classic Tetris theme. A tune you'll whistle along for days - so beware! The final track is a collab with chiptunes roots rocker GOTO 80, a remix of it can be found on his "_2_4x4"-EP.

For the technically interested: all songs were tracked by Dubmood on the Atari 1040 STfm in maxYMizer, made by gwEm, using the YM2149 soundchip. That is, 4bit sound on 3 channels, one squarewave generator and one noisegenerator on a 16bit 8mhz machine with 1mb of RAM and no samples used!
