Rootah and disrupt unite again for an extremely smoked out jam session on two 
forgotten Wackies riddims as the "Jahtari Riddim Force". What you hear now is 
the result of when analogue gear pushed to its limits clashes with a sensi-
circuit-bent Laptop...

"Farmer In The Sky" comes along with a laid back but tricky bass pattern, 
hypnotically driven offbeats, a great organ line by Dub navigatah John Frum 
and generally lots of surprises up the sleeve of your virtual space suit. All 
that while giving a nod to Robert A. Heinlein's classic SciFi-novel of the 
same title.

On side B "Depth Charge" lifts off full force with deep echo madness, wide 
explosions in 3D, basslines coming straight from a Black Hole and crunchy 
8bit-Gamma-rays from beyond the dibbi dibbi rings of Saturn! 

Watch that tape hiss on your intercom!
