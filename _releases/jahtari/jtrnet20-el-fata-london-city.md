Dug out from the depths of the chest of unreleased Jahtari gems is this highly addictive vocal cut by El Fata on the so called "Survivor" riddim, recently appearing on Soom T's cracking "Dirty Money EP". A lyrical document from the dark days of Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair, this intense track with it's powerful message, unstoppable flow and El Fata's ultra-sweet harmony treament not from this world is bound to win hearts, minds and dancefloors alike.

Disrupt strips the tune down on B in an often requested bare version of the riddim, ready for rinsing it properly on your local sound with your fave MCs. So better have some mics and a fistful of green at hand before putting the virtual needle onto this lovely file.

For more goodness by El Fata definitely take at look at THIS deadly compilation, "JAHTARIAN DUBBERS Vol. 2"!
