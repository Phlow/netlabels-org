After their undying classic album from 2007/09 Bo Marley are finally back with a vengeance - and a massive ghettoblaster! Always ready to rock your backyard, street corner or..er..local super market the Harlev homeboys are once again powering up their Chariot Of Fire (aka. the Bo mobil) and drop a floor-devastating cassette here that effortlessly rolls up electrifying beats, short-wired robo-magic and a voltage drenched low-rider bass into one big, long...masterpiece.

The patented Bo space-lyrics in German/Danish warp mode are again dealing with the big timeless themes of our age: rocking it on stage (Wir Setzt Den Trend), rolling along with the Bo mobil (Rollen Vorbei), the joys of driving a scooter (Mofa Fahren) and Robot Cars ("with volt power - yeah!"). Kaptain Dreck joins the posse for one tune here, with a fistful of rhymes that would even impress He-Man himself.
