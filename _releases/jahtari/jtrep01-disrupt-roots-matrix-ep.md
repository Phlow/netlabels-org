Four deep digital dub roots tracks here on our first JAHTARI EP! Prepare for 18 mins full of speaker-shaking basslines, space-age sounds and general delay mayhem of bitcrushing deepness in a room between the CPU, SonicFiction and Rastafari!

The EP starts off with 'ROOTS MATRIX', a constantly tranforming dub of the classic 'Drum Song' riddim. 'THC 1138' is a haunting piece based on the digital version of 'Fade Away', driven by a bone-dry bassline and SciFi-movie sound bits. Following up is 'BOMB 20', with the great philosophic discussion between Bomb #20 and Doolittle, Captain of the star-destroying space vessel named 'Dark Star', over Lee Perry's 'Doctor On the Go'-riddim. A haunting melody within layers of tape delays! Last then is 'FOUNDATION BIT', an ultra-heavy, steady-evolving dub with exploding rooms, a membrane-crunching bassline and lots of surprises coming up. Deep, wide and broad - makes you wish you had a third ear! :) ENJOY!
