the first ever NET-7" on JAHTARI is a Dub based on the C64-game-soundtrack of the classic 'International Karate'. 100% Digital Laptop Reggae, haunting 8bit-melodies between Echo Chamber and Bitcrusher! If you always wanted to know how your Commodore C64 would sound on herb this is it! :)

Includes a version on the B-Side!
