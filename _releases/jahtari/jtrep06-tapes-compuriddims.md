Coming straight from a warehouse studio amidst the dirty streets of London-Hackney is this hissing beauty by Mistah Jackson "Bassbin" Bailey, here in the guise of his project TAPES.

Picking up the tradition of 1960ies pioneers of electronic music, like the people at the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, Giampiero Boneschi, Piero Umiliani and all the other forgotten library heroes, TAPES is taking it an easy step further towards bass country. Blowing a healthy dose of Ganja smoke into ever-spinning wheels of his 4-track machine and clashing it properly Dubwise with skanking subs, hi-current powered drummachines and a heap of MAX-MSP madness the result will simply make your ghettoblaster weep with joy...

This release will also be available on a strictly limited CASSETTE edition - yeah !! Along with the Compuriddims EP comes more fun on the B-Side - a Dub sample library for your own sample pleasure! This library is released under CC -nd. Meaning you're explicitely allowed to use those sounds in your own productions, alter them, twist them and even SELL them!
