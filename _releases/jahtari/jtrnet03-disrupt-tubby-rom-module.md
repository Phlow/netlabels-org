Very deep and very slow dub of King Tubby's digital 'Tempo'-riddim with lots of space for long, evolving echos, reverbs and sounds out of nowhere! Highly hypnotic piece, set your player to 'infinite loop mode', your ears on 'extra wide' - and then insert this JAHTARI music cartridge!

On the B-Side new Jahtari artist OVR THRUSTR stretched the classic 'Rockfort Rock' riddim to its mathematical limits. Quantization errors are the basic principle here, along with formant echos, wide rooms, surprising breaks and a voice from outer space! disrupt edit.
