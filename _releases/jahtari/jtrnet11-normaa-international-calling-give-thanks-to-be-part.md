Two pieces of pure Digital Roots Reggae, this time from new Jahtarians
NORMAA. On Side A "International Calling" kicks forward with rocking drums and a rough bassline that will move your booty instantly! The interlaced rhythms, cut-up roots glitches and cunning FX treatment perfectly catch the essence of the Digital Laptop Reggae approach. Chip Roots to the bone!

On B "Give Thanks To Be Part" unfolds an highly hypnotic mind movie of pure consciousness, blending strong roots vibes with soulful comutah work and creating an unique, suspenseful deepness that can be explored even deeper many times over. Normaa style. Groove along!
