Both tracks of our second NET-7" are based on one of the most hypnotic WACKIES riddims that is, named 'UNDER WORLD' in one version and 'BASEMENT SESSION' in another. We picked up a loose trail from both these versions. While the A-Side is following more the first one, the B-Side goes for the latter.

'Loose In Space' is a re-ordered and re-edited jam-session with the riddim. The result is a constant movement and an overall live-feeling with deep surprises behind every corner that drive the track hyptnotically forward!

'The Stars My Destination' is quite different from the A-Side then, rougher, more focused on the atoms of each echo and with more 8bit (up to 24bit!) your processor can handle!

Fasten your seatbelts and extinguish all cigarettes! Thank you!
