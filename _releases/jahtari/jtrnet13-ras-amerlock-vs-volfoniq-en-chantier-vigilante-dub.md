Two Jahtarian Heavyweight Dub Champions in the ring for a wicked infight over two rounds! Until the bitter end of the B-Side's final groove. Beware of bass exploding hits to the head and the deeper regions!

Round One, titled "En Chantier", kicks off heavily on the Drum Song riddim with a rough, punchy skank, a haunting melody line and dirty shuffling machine beats.

The bout seamlessly continues on Side B with "Vigilante Dub" on a new riddim. This time aiming for extreme deepness with wide hypnotic pads and cunning feint attacks of the bassline which are being delivered with the hypnotic techniques of true Dubartial Arts. Don't forget to put in your teeth protectors for that bassdrum!
