Prepare for a flashing hitchhiking trip through the sonar landscapes of dubby history with our NET-EP 04, where Ras Amerlock is about to give you an exclusive lift aboard his hidden space ship laboratory!

Feeling the ever-present aftermaths of such Dub fundamentalists as Scientist, King Tubby or Lee Perry all the way through your journey you will wonder if the legendary Black Ark studio really dissolved into its own mythical ashes - or if it hasn't reintegrated back into a new orbit just now.

Ras Amerlock's crazy 3D-dubness experiments will take you far beyond the black hole of historical emulation. "Farther East" is rather an echo-driven time machine, jumping from a glorious past straight to an unknown future, conveying deep studies into bassline gravity, Zero-G-offbeat science and deadly Snare-Blasters underway. Leaving a long trail of green haze in its wake. Fasten your seatbelts and have something conical ready!
