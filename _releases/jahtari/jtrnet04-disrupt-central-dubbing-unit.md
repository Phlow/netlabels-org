A slamming, shuffling and highly kicking piece of true Digital Laptop Reggae! Raw and biting chords over crunchy, deep-rolling and onward-driving basslines on a re-adjusted riddim-grid are the foundations of our fourth NET-7inch here on Jahtari. Bits in several tape delay engines, reverbs coming from nowhere going to elsewhere, a break you might not have expected and always a surprise behind each offbeat!

The dub on the B-side is a bit more reduced in its elements, thus creating more space for the hypnotic aspects of the riddim and the evolution of effects. Enjoy this one with headphones and a halucinogen of your choice!
