Rough and fresh vocal cut by Wheeler in his totally unique style on the so-called "Turtle Riddim" by the Maffi homeboys, better known from our first Maffi-7" (Mikey Murka's long gone "Downpressor Man"), which is already a rare collector's item by now.

"Breeze Blow" was recorded at Swallofield, Kingston, by Selectah Easy T Jam from Esperanza sound during his stay in Jamaica almost a year ago. The ultra-productive posse around Black Warrior, I Bogle, I David, Wildlife, Triple D and - of course - Mr. Wheeler came up with tons of dynamite tracks on loads of fresh riddims during those 4 months, some of them are destined to appear on vinyl soon.

Wheeler runs a small shop for beer, juice, ice and cigarettes near the entrance of the Swallofield Ghetto. The lyrics of âBreeze Blowâ were created together with Black Warrior and some other singers, who live around Wheeler's place and drop by all the time. Recored with most minimum equipment and in a 100% yardstyle fashion, this rough and unforgettable tune comes hi-charged with good vibes and nuff green to haunt you for weeks.
