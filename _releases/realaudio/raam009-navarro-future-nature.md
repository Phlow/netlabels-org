navarro from paris (.fr) returns with a brilliant second visit from paris to realaudio.ch. implementing voices and his own piano playing gives navarro's music another special "bouquet".

after his highly acclaimed album "please, sit down" he composed a soft and warm follow up. continuing his path on the "french melange" of field recordings with synthetic sounds.

music we all like to listen to, when imagining a future in harmony with nature.
