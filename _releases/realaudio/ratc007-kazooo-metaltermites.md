kazooo from south germany (.de) strikes back with a bunch of serious clubtracks.

after releases on various labels he focussed on his studies in media culture and sounddesign on max/msp in context with conceptual arts.

besides he continued the path, started with his debut ep "herbstlichter" (ratc003) on realaudio.ch, just implementing even more subtle details in his music. an album full of tech-grooves sounding like ricardo villalobos and gez varley would have met on a dancefloor.

solid rocking tunes for the dj case.
