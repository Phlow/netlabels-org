ronny pries from hamburg (.de) continues the journey heading to new sounds through better mixing skills. we already introduced the rohformat.de-headman with ramx006, but with his follow-up "mnmlsm118" he already goes two steps further.

as richie hawtin very recently stated, the most important developpements in music production these days happen in improving the way to interact with the computer. therefore more and more hardware-controllers are available and software is being adapted to these interfaces.

ronny shows us his longtime experience with the latest mixing software traktor 3.0 by native instruments, and built a long and flowing mix without pre-production. using new possibilities like on-the-fly-loops and consequently concentrating on netaudio, he bundled a wide selection of high quality minimal techno of today.

get ready for the show!
