ronny pries from hamburg (.de) is well known for his virtuos dj sets with final scratch, which he played at tresor berlin and in clubs all over europe.

representing the head of labels like rohformat.de, schleudertrauma and t- his backcatalogue consists of uncountable releases under various pseudonyms, and he nowadays earns his living only by producing electronic music.

his close contacts to farbrausch.com the world's leading demo-label keep him up to date concerning new developpements in digital audio-processing and mastering.

his mix for realaudio.ch starts with minimal, rolling over to harder techno and pearls of his huge digital archive, like dupont's legendary monotonoir ep and his own "marching through alaska" remix for danny kreutzfeldt.
