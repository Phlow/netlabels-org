rasterfahndung from bern (.ch) is one of the rare projects that wonderfully melt acoustic instruments with electronic music. the guitar of niklaus erismann and the laptop of marcel k√§gi have equal parts in these very harmonic works influenced by studies at bern's music conservatory. their release leads us from sunny-italian guitar chords over to ambient scapes with dadaistic-voices, and back to the classically-influenced maintheme "pizzicato suite". besides being involved in the project nebelle.ch, the two are also known for their chilling sofa-live-acts.

in these days of foggy langscape-walks each track feels like eating a crispy pizza with various ingredients on a sunny terrace somewhere in the south. and the musical ingredients are so tasty, that bern's own "troubadour" mani matter would have admired them.
