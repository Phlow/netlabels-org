Another debut on Monotonik, and honestly, somewhat of a spectacular one from SinQ&, aka Sander van Oirschot, a Dutch electronic musician who's produced, in his album 'Passage', one of our favorite works so far this year - and we're lucky enough to be able to release it for free, too!


In general, it's either an ambient hush or gorgeous blisslike nu-chill, reminiscent of some of the best of the genre, with 'Be Brave' rinsing out the evocative, Overpass building up a kind of slow train groove, and 'Are You There?' leading up to a soundtrack high. Things all end out with 'Epiloque', again gorgeous, and really the epitome of what Monotonik has tried to provide for the last few years - the best headphone music you can find.
