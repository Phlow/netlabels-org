The debut Monotonik release by Finnish recording artist and former Suojain label-owner, <a href="http://www.blamstrain.com">Blamstrain</a>, aka Juho Hietala, simply oozes classiness, as he pre-empts his forthcoming <a href="http://www.m3rck.net">Merck</a> CD, "Ensi", with these two deft pieces of electronic cipher. 

As befits someone with both MP3 and real-life releases on the label of choice for techno dons, <a href="http://www.thinnerism.com">Thinner</a>, "Etkno44" is sweeping, driving grooves all the way to the memory bank, whereas "Human" showcases a more touching, almost downtempo side whilst keeping admirably clear, clean beats to the fore.

So, whether you want to go straightahead with beats, or simply wander through striking melodies that almost call to mind early Luke Slater, "Etkno44/Human" allows Blamstrain to satisfy your most strenuous urges, or your non-existent money back. And that's our guarantee of quality to you, guv'nor.
