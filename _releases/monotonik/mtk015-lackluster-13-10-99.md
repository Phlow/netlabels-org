The first sign of a Monotonik return would be <a href="http://www.lackluster.org">Lackluster</a>, aka Distance, purveyor of beautifully serene ambient idm, as signed to DeFocus Records in the UK, with a 12 out already and an album due soon.

But Monotonik is still lucky enough to feature some of his work, and this exclusive mp3 delves deeply into classic Lackluster territory, with shuffling percussion, layers and layers of pure sinewaves drifting over the top, and echo after echo symbolising the wind drifting icily over the ships in Helsinki harbour, perhaps? Pretty much a must-download.
