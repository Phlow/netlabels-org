The return of the spaced cowboy comes in the form of this newly minted Vim! track, with the UK artist fresh from his new Surgery album, "Linden - The Home Of The Hits". And actually, this great track isn't on that CD, since it's a special, exclusive tribute to all those classic old .MOD instruments and instrumentals everyone used to adore, with a newskool spin on it - hence the name of the track.

So, if you're digging the whole dumb drumbreak breaking things up a bit, plus the funked-up piano and bass weirdness making it all into a sorta neo-Squarepusher goes 1989 Soundtracker evolution, you'll probably dig this track. Put it this way, nobody else is making music like this - they wouldn't dare.
