The first Hoffman release in 6 months finds our English beatfreak in fine fettle, with a corker of an electro-ish techno track, at least partially inspired by the likes of Luke Slater (hence the title, echo-ing Planetary Assault Systems!)

As per usual, the vital Hoffman phase and form and function get together and blast a beautiful swathe through the canyons between your ears. It's the strings and the booming bassdrum kickdrum and the trippy melodies that really make us go boom. Dubnobasswithourheads, mon?
