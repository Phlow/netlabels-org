Completely transmogrified from its original Mono211 release, this amazing remix comes from Swedish artist Frank Bolero, who's been floating around negativspace for some time, along with his partner in crime Bill Yard.So what was once ninja-esque breakz flips right around into the kind of pure tones and drop dead lovely melodies that are hopefully coming to characterise the Monotonik label - sinewave arpeggios, shuffling drums, phasing bass, drifting chords.. makes you wanna die, no? Or sigh. Or smile. Yes, let's smile.
