This time, a Monotonik debut for Finnish graphic artist and musician Flutterspot, and pretty much his first music release anywhere, with the gorgeous electronic tones of 'Labmat'.

What do we like about this? Well, for starters, 'Daily Sway Of Everything (That You Touch)' is satisfyingly chunky, before 'Sky So My' segues into some smartly rotating beats. Then, there's 'Liihko Hymn', which is layers and layers of sound in an almost shoegaze fashion, but with firm rhythms layered on top, before 'World End Ballad' brings things to a close in an unnaturally fluid manner.
