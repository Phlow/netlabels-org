A return to Monotonik duties from Swedish artist Anders Svensson, formerly a Scandinavian indie band stalwart, and following up his debut Monotonik EP with another 3 tracks of wonderfully elliptical, genuinely original takes on the whole electronic music thing.

First up, 'Making It Personal' does that almost-cylical gorgeously crystallic thing than so many of Anders' tracks seem to, before 'Facing Trouble' drifts beautifully around the question, all coy and drifting. Finally, 'Sooner As Well As Later' patters the percussion and pitters your heart with pure tones and delicate drums.
