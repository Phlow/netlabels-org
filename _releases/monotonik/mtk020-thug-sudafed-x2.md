Australian idm wonderboy Thug, aka Tim Koch, lets us borrow some moreof his latest and greatest tracks for exclusive mp3 releaseon Monotonik, and boy, are we glad he did. This particular tune weaves the dense idm melodies (that has him compared to early Black Dog) with complex rhythms and hues to create somethingrather original.

"Sudafed x2" continues to delight on multiple listens, not leastbecause of the strange static impacted undertones, but in themain because it's just beautiful techno music.
