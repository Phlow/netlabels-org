We like it when old friends return to Monotonik, and after his very well-received EP on our net.label last year, Holland's excellent Secede provides a truly epic new track, "The Whistler", ahead of his "Bye Bye Gridlock Traffic" album forthcoming on <a href="http://www.m3rck.net">Merck</a>, and his smart-ola remix work for <a href="http://www.n5md.com">N5MD</a> and Merck.

It's good to thrive on angles, and "The Whistler" plots a course away from your average pure-toned geektronica, edging ever-closer to the template of instrumental bands like Mogwai and the denser, more pressing grooves of Richard H Kirk's early Warp material. Taking echoes of news footage, sampled violin, and the shimmering sounds of layer after layer of sound, the percussive groove builds and builds in altogether yummy fashions.

So, if you're looking for a way to submerge yourself in music in these troubled times, or just to discover that there's more to electronica than the eternal glitches vs. sinewaves ruckus, you may want to go have a word with "The Whistler". Like, already.
