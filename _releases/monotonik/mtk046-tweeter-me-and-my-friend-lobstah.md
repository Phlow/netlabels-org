Having previously been associated with Substance's excellent net.mod.label Voodoo, Finnish musician Tweeter comes out with his debut for Monotonik, and it's a real treat.

"Me And My Friend Lobstah" is a sinewave-smooth electronic trip with boil+bubble drums and widening echo-styled passages leading out to the fill-out, the breakdown, the true wide-screen style. It's strangely reminiscent of an earlier era, the early 90s, but in the best possible way - not retro, just as good as the original stuff.
