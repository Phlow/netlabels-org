The second release on Monotonik for Australian artist Super Science, this breathy, expansive mp3 comes from his first CD on Surgery Records, "Love Like Life In Miniature".

"Sometimes We're Happy", like much of the album, combines stylish vocal-punctuated tectonics with unexpected blips and beeps, always keeping it melodic, always constructive, always new. But most of all, with the voice-layering and the soaring chords, this music is soulful. Comparisons? A more videogame-savvy Capitol K, perhaps.. at any rate, you owe yourself a listen to find out.
