Courtesy of probably the most renowned artist on Monotonik, Finland's pukka idm maestro <a href="http://www.lackluster.org">Lackluster</a>, late of DeFocus Records, Merck, Rikos, and a host of other labels, we have a rare treat - a full, hour-long live set recorded at Helsinki's M-Bar in July 2003.

There, using a laptop running the great Ableton Live software, Esa 'Lackluster' Ruoho mashed up classic Monotonik tracks, remixes, and on-the-spot jams into a cohesive whole - highlights include a gorgeous unreleased track, the super-catchy Ceniq remix which formerly featured on seminal netlabel Milk, the splicing of some surprising breaks into the classic downtempo of 'Bothersome (Mother Mix)', and the final jazzy ambience of a cunning Proem remix, bizarre voice modulations and all. Much kudos to Lackluster for not only recording the moment, but allowing us to put it out for free - return the favor and pick up some of his vinyl or CDs when you have the chance?
