Vae, most excellent proprietor of the net.label Kahvi, kindly gives us his 2nd release on Monotonik, and this one's a treat - melodically beautiful, and complete with ambient duck.qwak action, the key element of any classic song in this day and age.

So whether it be the nifty serene organ loop or the shuffle-crack percussion which really give you the chills on this particular number, Vae's friend (the fowl who's silver, of course!) provides a touching, emotion-filled experience for all of us. Just say yes to feeling in electronica, huh?
