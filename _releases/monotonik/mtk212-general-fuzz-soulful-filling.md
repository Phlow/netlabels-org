As we edge into summer, we're proud to give further exposure to a gorgeous album submitted to Monotonik late last year from James Kirsch, aka General Fuzz, and the truly spectacular chill-out electronic that is 'Soulful Filling'.

Having grown up in Newton, MA, General Fuzz is happy to make his home in the San Francisco Bay Area, and he recruited a number of talented local live musicians to fill out the electronic sounds on this charming full-length album.

Highlights? Well, pedal steel has been a key part of the best chillout for many years now, and 'Warm Steel' is a great example of that in action, while lead-off track 'Eye Heart Knot' has a tremendously evocative, interlocking set of melodies around it.
