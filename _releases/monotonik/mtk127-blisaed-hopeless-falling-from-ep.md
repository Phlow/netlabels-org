Returning after his debut 'As Time Passes EP' of last year, US electronic artist Matt Centonze, aka <a href="http://www.blisaed.com">Blisaed</a>, who's been continuing to release excellent material on netlabels such as <a href="{{ site.url }}/camomille/">Camomille</a> and <a href="{{ site.url }}/ronin-collective/">Ronin Collective</a>, graces us with another gently beautiful 4-track EP of vocal-specked, emotion-tinged electronics.

This time round, debut song 'Photo' starts things off with casually gorgeous melodies, all multi-layered and shimmering and oxidizing slowly as it's exposed to the air, before 'A Silent Walk In The Park' kicks in, whisper-sung vocals, longing, and odd beauty to the fore. From there on, 'The One You Thought You Knew' hits up a stop-start, almost Super Science-like groove of understated splendor, before 'Showing Her What You're Made Of' ends up with an even more herky-jerky, hyperreal mix of attractive keyboards and gently caressing synths.

So, 'Hopeless Falling From EP' makes a lot of sense, both as another document of the resurgence of melodic electronic music in the U.S., and as a Monotonik release that fits into our sekrit agenda of releasing ths most gorgeous headphone music we can possibly find, and then spraying it out to the general public in a machine-gun fashion. Catch this one in your teeth, willya?
