An mp3 single taken from the limited-edition CD by Lackluster (aka Distance), this track finds him in typically drifting, understated, beautifully pin-sharp ambient form. Chords steal quietly over the top of quietly pulsating drums and weirdly insistent bass, like the slow conquering tides.. perfectly balanced, electronics practically sound natural when they're like this.

Compare and contrast to any other mellow ambient idm you like, in the end nobody sounds quite like Lackluster (but, of course, he doesn't sound lacklustre at all - and there's the paradox.)
