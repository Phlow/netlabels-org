Nowadays, Mosaik's Jakob Svanholm, aka Radix/Tpolm from his demo-scene days, is on a musical hiatus, as far as we know - apart from classical guitar pieces, that is. But we here at Monotonik have been so enchanted by his tracks as Mosaik that we've been slowly releasing them over the past year or two.

This track, "Sunreal", is the culmination of that music, and hopefully we'll be hearing brand new material from Mosaik soon, but in the meantime.. believe us, this more than suffices. Almost magically delicate, this 9-minute track slowly eases us into an almost Global Communication-like ticking clock world of sunny, haze-drenched sounds.

Whatever Mosaik ends up doing in the future, we know he'll be making an appearance on the forthcoming Monotonik mix-CD with one of his classic compositions, and both his Radix and Mosaik material will continue to fascinate in their deftness of touch and fleetness of tone. Sounds good to us. Yay.
