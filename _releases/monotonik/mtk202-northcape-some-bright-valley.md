A Monotonik debut for Brighton, UK-based electronic artist Northcape, then, with the sublimely mellow 'Some Bright Valley', all chilled-out strings and gently departing sunsets.

Previously having debuted a couple of self-released albums, this first netlabel release starts out with the cutely meandering 'Red Panda', before moving on to the even more gorgeously pastoral, almost triphop-flecked 'A Part Of The Forest'.

Also in there - 'Low Lying Mist' and EP closer 'On The Hill', which uses smart and beautiful repetition to make a chilled-out, signature Monotonik sound, awkward percussion making things all the better. Viva la Northcape!
