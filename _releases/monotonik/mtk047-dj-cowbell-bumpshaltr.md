As a special Valentine's Day release for Monotonik, we're truly proud to present an elusive release from the reclusive DJ Cowbell.

"Bumpshaltr" is the first mp3 ever to be released from the master of broken beats, who first gained fame by spinning solely to a bovine audience in the Mid-West USA, and whose live sets frequently result in region-wide 'state of emergency' alerts and large numbers of sonic casualties, some permanently unable to ever listen to power ballads again.

So, in our quest to find something truly fitting for such a romantic occasion, we felt "Bumpshaltr", with its careful counterpoint of noise, sound, and , well, more sound, fits our aegis (sonix) perfectly. So sit down with your loved one this V-Day, open a carefully chilled Chianti, dim the lighting, and relax with this beautifully crafted message from Monotonik to you..
