It seems like there's plenty of great electronic music coming out of Russia recently, with critical acclaim for artists such as EU and Novel23. So we're pleased to put out this EP from Russian duo Sleepy Town Manufacture, fresh from a compilation appearance on Russian label Cheburec Records, and looking to be new millenial messiahs for idm east of Berlin and west of Tokyo.

So, "Miss EP" shines up a real treat, with opener "Don't You Miss Me?" hitting up wonderfully pure tones and ice-encrusted production, all classy, all the way. Then there's shifting of gears through "Ena", with slide-style percussives and angelic sines, and the rhythm-heavy "Nuut", almost click-house bipbop action. And it all ends up with the seruphimally orchestral "Ostavshis". Just so you know - the steppes of change start right here, right now.
