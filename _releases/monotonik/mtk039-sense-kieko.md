After his Oompa-Loompah-worrying first track on Monotonik and his divine Lackluster remix for the "R U Oho?" 12" on DeFocus, Sense comes out with another gorgeous mtk.release ahead of his Aural Industries EPs due out later this year.

"Kieko", then, would be quietly dazzling idm-ish techno of the highest order - all pattering synths and gently reverberating drums, a subtle waterfall of sound. Like a lot of recent Monotonik releases, forget your glitch, let's worship the melody, guvnor. Check the technique - see if you can follow this?
