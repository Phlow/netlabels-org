Whilst our long-time companion Vim! is preparing for his second album on <a href="http://www.surgeryrecords.com.au/">Surgery</a>, upcoming material on <a href="http://www.civikrecords.com">Civik</a>, and his appearance on the Machine Drum remixLP on <a href="http://www.m3rck.net">Merck</a>, he's been doing some sabbatical work on the VERY cool Nintendo Gameboy music creation software package,<a href="http://www.littlesounddj.com">'Little Sound DJ'.</a>

So, exclusively for the benefit of Monotonik types, we have this megamix-styled Vim! jam, "Time For The Squares", all created just using an old-style black+white Nintendo Gameboy and LSDJ! Spanning over 11 minutes, it starts with some serious bassline + drum-roll callisthenics, before transitioning into arpegiating goodness and off-beat, pure, sinewave-y melodies, and finishing off, supremely, with a cover version of Leftfield's "Phat Planet", complete with robotvoicesampled bliss.

We think the particularly neat thing about this megamix is that it sounds pretty different from the majority of lo-fi, retro stuff out there - there's no overdone chords, there's no excessive saccharin. What there is is surprisingly complex beats and a harder, cleaner aesthetic that, ultimately, pays off bigtime. We claim.
