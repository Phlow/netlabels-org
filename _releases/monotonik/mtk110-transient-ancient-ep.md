We're delighted to present a debut EP from US artist <a href="http://www.frontiernet.net/~transient/">Transient</a>, in the form of "Ancient EP". With previous releases on Darla, Skylab Operations, and TBTMO, his enchanting electronica has been wandering happily around the world fora while now, and we're happy to hasten its passage with thisrelease.

The debut track, "Gypsonic", sets the mood perfectly, with sweeping synths, complex and beautiful rhythms, and agorgeously floating end product. The rest of the tracks on theEP only continue with that tradition, with "Tiny Flame",all complex beats and smooth, smooth melodies, plus the guitarinflected "Self Validating Chipmunk" remix other highlights ofthis EP. So remember, if you want to stay happy for the permanent,choose Transient.

[Also, Transient released a 20mb <a href="http://www.scene.org/file.php?file=/music/artists/transient/transient-vigorous_chipmunk_%28monotonik2003%29.zip&amp;fileinfo">trailer video</a> for this release, featuring the song "Vigorous Chipmunk" plus some really nice cut-up, treated ambient video footage which reminds us of the cool Transambient TV/DVD series. Go grab it, if you haven't seen it.]
