A debut of distinction, this, as a brand-new artist from the UK, Aereal, kindly grabs our attention with this emotional "Connect"-ion that truly shines.

Reminiscent of the rangiest early 90s material from dark canines and their ilk, "Connect" blends the background industrial clank to the lushest of strings and percussive clicks to make, honestly, one of the dreamiest tracks we've put out in ages. And if Aereal isn't significantly more well-known, significantly quickly, we'll eat our post-ironic DJ Touche-style cloth cap.
