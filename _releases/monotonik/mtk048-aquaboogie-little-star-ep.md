A return visit to Monotonik from New Zealand-based artist Aquaboogie, and again his very distinctive, almost dreamily spaced-out electronics surface from the Antipodean haze.

First up, "Little Star" brings a kinda Isan-ish calm and simplicity to an ambient haze of a track, with angelic, metallic, computer-generated lullaby over the top of some delightfully re-focusing strings.

Then, "Insecure Robot" brings another Adams-ian piece of whimsy to life, whether intentionally or accidentally, with blooped-up electro and paranoid androids going a little barmy on the emotion front. Punk to funk, super electro style..
