It's always a pleasure to introduce someone new onto Monotonik, and in this case, it's German composer and DJ, Crashkid, who brings a more organic, acoustic edge to our sound with this 2-track EP.

"Stair" is almost hiphop-like in its rhythmically shuffling beats, but with structured guitar overlays and subtle phrasing, you can see why Crashkid counts My Bloody Valentine alongside more conventional electronica as some of his main influences. The second half of the EP, "Telerain", brings more picked acoustic guitar loops over gorgeous sinewave chords - mm, forbidden tones of devilish attractiveness have seduced us.
