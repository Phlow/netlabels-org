We're delighted to present a second release from Finnish graphic artist and musician Flutterspot, following the 'Labmat EP' back in early 2006, and this time round, 'Suitable For A Desire To Share' is almost 40 minutes of lushly layered electronic music to die for - or at least freeze a little bit.

We start off with the oddly titled 'Small, Brightly Coloured, Highly Arboreal', which hops up into the trees for some almost Boards Of Canada-esque loping beats and marvellously complex electronic beats. From there on, there's just all kinds of mature fun to be had, with 'Cumulonimbus Arcus' looping all over the place in delight.

What else? Blimey, 'A Minor Lovesong' is all guitars and style and 'Hover In Mid-Air' is semi-ambient bliss, and this all adds up to one of the most accomplished Monotonik releases we've had in some time - so everyone say thank you to the mysterious Flutterspot, eh?
