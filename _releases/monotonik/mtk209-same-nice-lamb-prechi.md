Returning with his second, long-awaited EP on Monotonik, Same Nice Lamb, aka Justin Hassler, delivers us six exquisite tracks of electronic music in the form of 'Prechi'.

From opening track '8 Seconds Ahead' through the closer, 'Origen's Lament (Last Week I Was A Man)', the EP features beautiful leads, atmospheric effects, and a melodic throughline to die for.

You might also particularly enjoy 'The Inhibitionist' for services to wondrous melody. In any case, delight in the sounds, and thanks again to Same Nice Lamb for letting us release this on Monotonik.
