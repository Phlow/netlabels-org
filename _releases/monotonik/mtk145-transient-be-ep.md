Starting out, we have 'Ice', a great stepping-off point for the experience, with pin-sharp percussion and dreamy melodies firmly to the fore. Then we get gratifyingly choppy, with 'Pinocchio Jazzhands' a strutting, funky electronic melange. A brief pause, with 'Treelighting Ceremony...' and its constant ambient waves, and 'The Triumphant Return Of The Vigorous Chipmunk' blasts up a continuation of a theme on Transient's last Monotonik EP with aplomb. Finally, 'Ace' provides a counterpoint for 'Ice' and ends things off in style, all pulsing, almost Steve Reich-tinged swirling, repeating melodies with strange, wondrous complexity - marvellous.
