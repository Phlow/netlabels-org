There's still time to introduce new artists we think are rather spiffing here, and Finland's Lindon would be one of those. "Eksajoule" is a driftingly backed rhythmic idm treat, with mini-drum-fireworks lit every few seconds and a backing lilt which is truly beautiful. Some more of that more melodic idm that we like so much chez Monotonik? We fear so.
