Calmness in the face of glitchversity is something that Monotonik prizes highly indeed. So when we had the opportunity to release this track from the UK's Xela, who has an album forthcoming on the divine Neo-Ouija label, plus appearances on material from Musik Aus Strom and Merck.. well, we got straight on the case.

The reason "Rainy Afternoons" hits the spot for us is that Harold Budd-esque underlying serenity, but with a carefully cultivated veneer of layer upon layer of stuttering static, melody, speech and lovingly crafted detritus. It builds and peaks and troughs and never stops. And, like skipping radio frequencies over and over, the whole creation is much more than the sum of its carefully constructed parts. Hats off to the man who experienced that rainy afternoon.
