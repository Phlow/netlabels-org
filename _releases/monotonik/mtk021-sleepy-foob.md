Alaskan ambient maestro (and artist behind the first ever Monotonik mp3 release) Jiva, returns for this gorgeous piece of ambient-drone-rock-idm under his Sleepy alter-ego. This track features sampled and processed guitars by the man himself, along with a healthy dose of background noise and beautifully shuffling percussion.

Perhaps a little reminiscent of Budd or Eno, but a little more contemporary than that, this is the kind of track you can put on permanent repeat play and not notice for hours, in a good way. Monotonik is now, more than ever, music to fall asleep to.
