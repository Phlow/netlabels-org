When Jansky Noise lobbed us this tiny, but perfectly distorted exclusive mp3 to help promote the forthcoming <a href="www.planet-mu.com">Planet Mu</a> releaseof <a href="http://www.sp-jn.co.uk/">Speedranch + Jansky Noise</a>'s <a href="http://www.planet-mu.com/ziq071.html">'Migrate'</a> album, we were delightedto help unleash it on the unsuspecting public. Hence.. here it is.

A little background: Speedranch is the veteran noisemaster who recently collaborated with Venetian Snares on a Planet Mu album,and with James Plotkin and others for the Phantomsmasher releaseon Mike 'Faith No More' Patton's <a href="http://www.ipecac.com/">Ipecac</a> label. Jansky Noise is one of the people behind the shadowy and always genius <a href="http://www.brainwashed.com/vvm/newsmain.htm">V/VM</a> collective and their myriad of releases, and together with Speedranch they released the 'Welcome To Execrate' album on<a href="http://www.posteverything.com">Leaf</a> in 1999.Now they're coming out with 'Migrate' on Planet Mu, and youcan check out sound samples on the <a href="http://www.planet-mu.com/ziq071.html">Planet Mu discography page</a>. But if you're looking for something that didn't make the album, but had every right to, here's 30 seconds of noise, maniacalcut-up burbling, and general goodness, showing a brief interlude of insanity does everyone the power of good.
