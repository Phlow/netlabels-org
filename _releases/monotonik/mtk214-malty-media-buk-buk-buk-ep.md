Malty Media is, of course, previous Monotonik releaser Aquaboogie and long-time veteran idm artist Jet Jaguar, creators of the 'Bracken Bed' EP on the label a while back, and they kick off the final set of MTK releases with this fine piece of frippery.

The New Zealand-based group's style is best described as 'whimsical Orb-like soundscapes with an Antipodean twist', perhaps, and these four-track pulses through gently chicken-clucking debut track 'Chook Nocturne', before settling on gently glowing tracks like 'See To Her'.

It all ends up with the practically funky 'My Little Aircraft', and all goes to show that sampling, while a little silly, is never bad for your health. Good health to you, Malty Media!
