A new EP from a brand new artist, Icelandic bringer of non-tranquility Vektrex, and whilst "Jacket From Planet Pluto" is an eloquent electro-ish track with a sneaky 'masters-of-triphop' sample and urgent, clicking percussion, the crazed beeps of "Perfect Pitch" bring to mind a NES game gone horribly, horribly wrong. Timestretching chip-chords and pitchbending sinewaves? Yikes, call the Game Genie right now!
