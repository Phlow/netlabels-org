A Canadian/Polish duo who've been floating around the Monotonik nexus for a good while, and finally got sucked in, this deliciously playful EP mirrors the v-idm-eogame aesthetic of their recent, and very well received "Pistachio Island" album on Merck Records, and their two smart tracks for Neo-Ouija's "Cottage Industries 2", in a deft touch and wonderful attention to detail.

The mini-journey starts with "Lagomorph Jump", replete with layered chord jams, clever stops and starts, and intriguingly offbeat melodies, before "Let Irmine Do The Math" slides into view, pushing a quiet storm with initially proud ambience, then oddly proto-jazz groove. And to end it all, "New Cupboard From Ikea" is absolutely classic idm, with noble squeaks and proud stutters to the fore.
