And the Monotonik experience couldnt be complete without a new release from the English madprofessor, and, we contend, one of the true individuals behind Monotoniks quality, Vim!.

Fit At The Front reminds us a tiny bit of the AFX remix of Baby Fords Normal in the way it keeps the braindance going, but ducks and dives, spins and parries, in that uniquely screwed Vim!-style way. The melodies are weird as hell, the drums are boom bap boom in unexpected flurries, and it all adds up to a damn good time for your mp3 player.
