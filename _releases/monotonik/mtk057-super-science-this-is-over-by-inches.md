Another release from Australia's darling, and no, we don't mean Dame Edna, rather Super Science, whose Surgery Records album, "Love Like Life In Miniature", is a Gulliver-like masterpiece of melody, vocals, and beautifully fractured beats - as we've said before, something with the crossover appeal and unique angle of an artist like Capitol K.

This time round, "This Is Over By Inches" loops up the distinctive Super Science sound - delicate synths, snatches of repeated phrases and unique-sounding hums of melody, and puts a gorgeously twisty sheen over the top. There's so many layers of cosmic+melodic debris in there, we're going to have to go ahead and call it the asteroid belt in the mote in God's eye.
