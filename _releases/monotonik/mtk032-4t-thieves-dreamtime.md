Having last released a track on Mono almost exactly 4 years ago, it's really been quite a long time away from the label for Isle Of Wight,UK/Finland based 4T Thieves, who's an oldskool Amiga demo-scener of the highest grade, and also operates under the name Soundstate.

However, his return to the Monotonik fold is much welcomed, and this particular piece of casually expansive retro-activeness is strangely early-90s, in the best 'Artifical Intelligence'-influenced ways. With soaring chords and layer upon layer of melodic electronics, you're guaranteed a good flight in an almost B12-ish way - or your money back...
