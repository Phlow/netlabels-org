Oddly-monikered enigma and force behind distinctly weirdass (mais cool) vinyl and CDs on the Kracfive and Underscore labels in the US, amongst others, Colongib has kindly deigned to release this exclusive track on Monotonik.

Full of truly crunchy sounds, but with some of the twistedbreak flava that Monotonik so lusts after, this particular mp3 is full of unexpected turns and stutters. Listen, by all means, but were not responsible for what happens if you try to dance..
