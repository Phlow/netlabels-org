This 4th album from Ernesto Aeroflot comes from a mysterious fellow who's released on net.label Commie and a host of smaller labels under names/groups such as TranceYlvania, Sky Wide Jazz, Oodi &amp; Elegia, High Grade Multi Purpose Intelligent Terminal (!), and more. This 10-trackalbum showcases his unpredictable but riveting style excellently, as '80s bleep sounds and stuttering electro mix up with distortedunrest, sweeping electronica, and a wholly surprising bonus cut to create something truly different.

Highlights? Well, tracks like "We Wish You A Merry Ca" evokesYellow Magic Orchestra, all smooth and retro, whereas "Be Real,Rysto Byls IV" is almost a widescreen movie soundtrack, and"Lost Data" is the most delicious of pseudo chip-tunes. Plus,the final superextrabonus track, "Afterburner", well.. Finnish.. surf guitar.. epic.. need we say more?
