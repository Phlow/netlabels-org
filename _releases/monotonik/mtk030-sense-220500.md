We're lucky enough to get another release from Australian quiet electronic.storm, Sense. Once languishing in slightly more obscurity than he deserved, his great remix of Lackluster for the DeFocus 12" ("R U Oho?") has put him squarely back on the idm radar, and there's going to be more Sense out on vinyl/CD in the next few months - a man to watch.

In this case, we're graced with a koto-laced ambient experience, "220500", delicately twined with echo and its twin brother, reverb, along with cicada-like hihats and quiet bleeps, to create one of those dreamlike moments you never want to leave, over and over again, until you never want to leave the moment where you think that you never want to leave. and so on.
