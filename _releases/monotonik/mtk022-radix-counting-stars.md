The first release on Monotonik for Radix, aka Mosaik, the Swedish artist who's been making a lot of waves in the PC 'demo-scene' over the past couple of years with his perfectly crafted melodies and beautifully smooth stylings. "Counting Stars" is the sound of a man who's clearly been listening to Boards Of Canada, but has seen fit to put his own spin on their innocent electronica.

What with the beautifully pitch-bent lead and the hypnotic voice drifting in and out of the background, Radix seems to have created a thing of beauty. Hopefully it'll be a joy forever, and in digital binary form, too. Do remember to keep it for your virtual grandchildren..
