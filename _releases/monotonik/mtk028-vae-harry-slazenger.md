And the band played on. With the band, in this case, being made up of the rather smart Finnish-type Vae, formerly known as Strala, and boss of the smart Net.label Kahvi (recently resurrected from purgatory, and looking all the better for it!)

In any case, "Harry Slazenger" (no relation to Jake, Vae assures us..) is an initially distant, suddenly pendulum-like swing through sweetly toned electronic pop music - like Kraftwerk without the Teutonic bent, or a massively slowed-down electro-machine of the kind Drexciya or Anthony Rother wield. Muha, it's subsonic speed robot boogie time again..
