All the way from Alaska, Jiva provides us with some truly serene idm in the style of the similarly remote but moving Boards Of Canada or Biosphere. Beautiful home listening for everyone, and well worth the download. And we know our French is schoolboy at best, but the title is definitely something about strolling across the seabed, isn't it?
