We're delighted to get the chance to release a new track from Australian electronica royalty and old-time Monotonik releasers,<a href="http://pleasurecraft.va.com.au/pbxo/">Pretty Boy Crossover</a>, aka PBXO. Previously, we released acouple of their tracks related to their excellent first Surgery CD, "The Building And Formation", and since then, they'vereleased another EP, "Any Number Can Play", on Clan Analogue, and are gearing up for new releases on Surgeryand C0C0S0L1DC1T1, as well as new tracks from the group they share members with, Other People's Children, on 555and Morr Music.

Anyhow, "17 Steps" is all gorgeously languid, slow motionmelodies, a breath of fresh air when only stuffiness and restriction rules the roost. The curiously hypnotic percussionbuzzes, the almost shoegaze-styled melodies hum, and allis good with the world, if only for those four minutes and thirty-nine seconds. Hurrah for the pretty boys and theircrossover skills, eh?
