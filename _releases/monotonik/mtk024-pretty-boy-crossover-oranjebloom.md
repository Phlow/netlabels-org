Due to our Thug-ish connections, Monotonik seems to be specialising in fragile idm from the cream of the new talent coming out of Australia right now.

So here's another label debut, from Pretty Boy Crossover (PBXO for short, but they prefer it long and ambiguous, and don't you forget it..) They're a duo who've been around for a few years now, developing their gently individual sound all the while, and recently got a lot of interest from Skam, home of.. well, a whole buncha famous people (Gescom, Bola, etc.)
