In an alternative universe, Tom Jenkinson, aka Squarepusher, is acknowledged as the true king of electronic music, not those spiky old bores, Aphex Twin and Autechre. And in that alternative universe, Finland's Fun Tourist is, well.. at least grand vizier. And probably senior vice-president in charge of snare rushes.

Regardless of folly, "DDD" is a truly spectacular piece of electronic music, complete with funky drums cut to ribbons, strange octave-pitched tribal chants, 8-bit heavy metal guitars, and beautiful intricacies of melody and tone. It's easy to see why Fun Tourist has a vinyl release forthcoming on the London label Worm Interface, who've been responsible for many beautiful moments from Plod, Solar X, Jake Mandell, and even that lovely Mr.Jenkinson himself.
