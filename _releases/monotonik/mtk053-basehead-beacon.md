A long-time denizen of the 'tracker' scene, and more recently a videogame musician on titles such as the multi-award-winning Ion Storm opus, "Deus Ex", we're delighted to release this great piece of clicked-up electronics from the Boston, US-based Basehead.

"Beacon" is a really special piece of clickish-house, with some of the sharpened drums and syncopated rhythms that characterise that particular subgenre. Add the deeper-than-subterranean sub-bass and echo-laden lead lines swimming in and out of the tune-mist, and you end up with a truly original-sounding track which is noticably different to a lot of the lusher, slower material Monotonik has been releasing of late. In any case, enjoy, and look out for more material from Basehead on Tektite Records soon.
