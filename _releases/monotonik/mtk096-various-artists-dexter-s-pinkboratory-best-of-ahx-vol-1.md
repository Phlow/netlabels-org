We here at Monotonik vehemently enjoy mixing up the brand-new idm goodness with some beeptastic sinewaviness from back in the day. And this sublime selection is the first in a series highlighting the little-known Commodore Amiga chiptune format, <a href="http://http//amigascne.org/abyss/ahx/">AHX</a>, which stands for 'Abyss' Highest Experience', and was a gorgeous effort to resurrect C64-style synthetic tunes later in the Amiga's life.

So we thought - who would be the best people to pick the best ever AHX tunes? Why, we went straight to the source, Martin 'Dexter' Wodoks and Manfred 'Pink' Linzner, the original creators of the AHX tracker format as members of Abyss, and nowadays successful Nintendo GB/GBA developers, with games such as "Iridion" and music for titles like "Tony Hawk's Pro Skater" with their company <a href="http://www.shinen.de">Shinen</a>.

What we got were 10 of the best AHX tunes ever tracked, as picked by Dexter+Pink, and showcasing musicians like smooth former C64-er D'aizl/Mystic, the dazzling Pink/Abyss himself.

AHX came in to being around 1995/6, quite late in the Amiga demo-scene's life, and its history has been further confused by the fact it was called THX for a time until George Lucas' lawyers kicked up a ruckus!

When it comes to downloading, we've provided mp3 versions of all of the tracks, but we had to guess at sensible points to fade out, since these tunes are all meant to loop for ever, like many older chiptunes.
