Another debut on Monotonik, and this wonderful multi-layered idm-ish vocal-scattered track is by another of the new skool of Australian electronic talent, Super Science, aka Clue To Kalo. Famous idm labels have been showing interest in this particular man, and I think we can see why from this busily static-flecked, almost robotically beautiful piece.
