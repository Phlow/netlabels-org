Continuing our interest in where the crunchy retro of videogame music meets the now and future of life away from your Nintendo, the mysterious AY88 (no name, no packdrill) delves deep into the innards of his primitive sound creation devices, and comes up with the exquisite tangent of "Console-Related Depression".

Thus, whilst the first part of the EP bounces solid analog bass with metronome-style backing and gorgeously smooth arpegiating to infinity in an almost .SID style, the second track really cuts up the drums to a shuffle and showcases more of the "L.E.D Storm"-ish cosmic arpeggios, and the final part blends cheeky leadsynth action with echo after echo.

All in all, it's almost as much euphoria as we'd have if the Konix Multisystem had actually got released, and as such, it's a result, a definite result, mon ami.
