As a perfect pre-Christmas release, we have this glacial but soulful debut from Canadian artist <a href="mailto:viz@mephtik.net">Vizion</a>, who is primarily known for forming the net.labels <a href="http://www.roninc.32k.org/">Ronin Collective</a> and <a href="http://www.camomille.32k.org/">Camomille</a>, but also has upcoming material on the real-life label <a href="http://www.wikkidrecords.com">Wikkid Records</a>, home of David Kristian and others.

In any case, "Autumnstillness Deadwinter" grabbed our attention with its sweet mix of guitar and gently meandering bass, with chattering percussion underscoring the whole serene scene. It's an unique angle on the indie-tronica that's broadening the whole idm genre into something a little more personal and intriguing right now.

So, as the stillness of autumn drifts into the ice of dead winter, we find that Vizion has created a perfect release to soundtrack the frost outside but the warmth and cosiness within. And long may he continue to warm our hearts in the most unexpected ways.
