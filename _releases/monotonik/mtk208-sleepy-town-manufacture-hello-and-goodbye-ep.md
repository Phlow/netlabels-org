Monotonik is delighted to present a new EP from Russian idm stars Sleepy Town Manufacture, some six years after they released their first tracks for the label.

The result is the evocative 'Hello And Goodbye EP', four tracks of wonderfully laidback electronic, starting out with the looping, languid 'Trem'. Next up is 'Oopon', showcasing all kinds of beautiful, pitchperfect chord and percussion action.

Finally, we have the slightly harder, more angular 'Zzujd', before we finish out with the title track, all kinds of phasing, pastoral sounds. We're very happy to have you back in Sleepy Town with us.
