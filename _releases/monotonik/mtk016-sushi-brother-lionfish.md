From the weirdly melodic but skewed Swede, Sushi Brother, comes this piece of jaunty, twisty, jazzfunkbreak-ish music thats almost completely uncategorisable..

If you start to mention Squarepusher meeting the fellow Swedes from the Dot label in an underpass somewhere, maybe.. well maybe thats a laughable comparison :) But its the only one weve got, so check out the feisty, squirmy lead and the spaz-out interludes and nod in disagreement..
