This is something very different from Hoffman - very difficult to describe, it sorta brings a different perspective to Monotonik. Skittering but solid beats, a simplicity which belies its complexity, this is techno, but not as we know it, Jim. Like a softer version of the kind of hard techno favoured by Jeff Mills and The Advent, perhaps, it wanders and phases but keeps up the 4/4 beats, ticking over above all. Sparkling and rough all at once, categorise this at your peril.
