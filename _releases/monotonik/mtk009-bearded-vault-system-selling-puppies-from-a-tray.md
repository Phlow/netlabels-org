This release comes from Bearded Vault System, and that's not a facial-hair-related security device, rather the pseudonymous Bauri of Saundart Recordings, purveyor of enchanting and sometimes wild electronic noises. This particular track is beguiling, almost fluid techno, with spiky melodies drifting in and out of focus, but plenty of blessed minimalism too. Highly recommended.
