We're very pleased to present this exclusive track from US-based artist Machine Drum, whose "Now You Know" album on Miami's Merck Records has been causing big waves (online plaudits, a vinyl repressing) with its neat blend of shredded hiphop rhymes and idm slickness.

So, "Floss" is a fascinating tangent from the style Machine Drum is best known for, precisely because it takes the driving, cut-up style associated with him, and applies it to another source, an altogether more loon(e)y proposition.

It's all about the tight, tight loops and the drifting, almost BoC- esque synth evocation percolating over the top. It's sharp, uptempo (a refreshing change from the ambience of many a Monotonik release), and most of all, it's original. One of these Drums is not like the others? Too right.
