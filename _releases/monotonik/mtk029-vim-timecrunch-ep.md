Monotonik is delighted to welcome the return of the plastic inevitable, hewn from solid nostalgia, Vim! :) As always, beavering away with his very own carefully skewed musical style, he serves up these 3 vignettes as the "Timecrunch EP".

The lead-off track, "Thin Strips Of You", hovers majestically in 3d.space before skittering around a retrig.forest, whereas "Jackie Batey" plays off the evocative arpegiating of classic Vim! with some subtle melodies - all too short, mind. Finally, "Angel Delight Saved Me" is a jaunty little trot through the vagaries of where milk-based desserts will take you in life.
