As a taster for the one-off and assuredly rather special forthcoming album, Monotonik is proud to present the final recordings of UK artist Binary.

Formerly signed to Planet Noisebox, and receptor of rave reviews in the NME for the 'awkward gracefulness' of the 'Music Of Sound' 10" and 'Brick Wall Music' album, Binary has now decided to leave the music industry altogether. his final album, 'Binatone', will be released through Monotonik, so everyone can enjoy his pithy blend of electro-tinged techno for free.

This mini-EP gives a little hint of things to come, with one of the best tracks from the album, "9899", plus a shuffling, sawtooth "Formel 2" remix by M.Gundlach (new Olympia, WA monotonik.cohort!)
