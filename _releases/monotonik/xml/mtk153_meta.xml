  <description>When Finnish-born, currently Irish-based idm veteran Lackluster, aka Esa Ruoho, insistently pinged us over IM to release this stunning single track, 'Zero Million Barrels Of Oil Per Day', he was keen that it go live before the global oil market reached its peak. We're not sure we actually managed that, but heck, we figure this almost 10-minute track will convey its mood perfectly well, separately of the amount of crude bubbling out of the ground at any particular speed.

Esa's &lt;a href="http://www.lackluster.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;official site&lt;/a&gt; reveals what he's been up to since last releasing on Monotonik &lt;a href="http://www.archive.org/audio/audio-details-db.php?collection=monotonik&amp;collectionid=mtk129" rel="nofollow"&gt;early last year&lt;/a&gt;, and it includes a new album, 'Slice', on excellent Belgian label U-Cover, as well as recent live gigs in Holland, Spain, France, and Dublin, as well as a forthcoming spot this November at the lab30 mini-festival in Augsburg, Germany.

So, what of 'Zero Million Barrels Of Oil Per Day'? Well, it starts soft, with almost imperceptible shifts in mood, before blasting into life and color, sonic earthquakes and melodic gushers to the fore. If anyone can refine pure noise into beauty, it's Lackluster, and this carefully crafted track does just that. More soon, please.</description>
