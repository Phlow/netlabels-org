  <description>Fresh from his appearance remixing Lackluster for the DeFocus-released "R U Oho?" 12" (FOC354), the Australian artist Sense, who's been around the music-scene a long time, and is finally getting more well-deserved recognition (he's played supporting Aphex Twin on his live Oz jaunts, and even now is being courted by Jeff Mills for his new label..)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Bubble Blower" is a wonderfully serene piece of ambient techno, calmly rippling through your speakers (or, indeed, headphones) with gently drifting synths, bass drum pirouettes, and snatches of.. well.. a certain Mr. Wonka and his guests, right? This is, honestly, one of the most beautiful pieces of music Monotonik's ever released - in our opinions, a future classic. But then, we're horribly biased, right?</description>
