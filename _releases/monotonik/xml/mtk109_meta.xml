  <description>We're delighted to present the final release in a trilogy of 'virtual 7-inches'from Australian Mark Mitchell, aka Super Science. These tracks were originallyreleased on the super-duper-limited Splashdown CDR series in 1999, and we'vepicked out the best unreleased tracks for Monotonik, to put out for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As mentioned before, &lt;a href="http://www.cluetokalo.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;Clue To Kalo&lt;/a&gt;, Mark's new project, has had its 'Come Here When You Sleepwalk' album picked up by &lt;a href="http://www.dirtyloop.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;Mush Records&lt;/a&gt; in the US and &lt;a href="http://www.posteverything.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;The Leaf Label&lt;/a&gt; in Europe, and we HIGHLY recommend checking that album out if you want to hear the evolution of his vocal-blended, lush style that has the guys at Leaf comparing him to early Badly Drawn Boy and Folk Implosion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time round, "Take The Time To Take A Trip" is a lush, keyboard-led ramblethrough indie-electronic eddies of sound, with a beautifully sung refrain and amarvellously laidback feel. The second track, "Greenwich Mean Time Machine",starts with birdsong and recordings of a summer's day, and then drifts througha nirvana of melody and pure sound. Good, good stuff.</description>
