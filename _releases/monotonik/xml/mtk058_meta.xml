  <description> A return release from Sweden's excellent Sushi Brother, another ex-demo-scener who's really kicking things with an unique elektronik style, this one even more indescribable and intriguing than a chocolate potato (or a deep-fried Mars Bar).Sushi Brother has his excellent 'Shadowfighter' former mtk.release out on 7" about now, courtesy of Bop Records, btw - it also includes the Frank and Bill remix we also released, and with Bill (Yard) apparently featuring on the new Brothomstates EP on Warp, it couldn't be a better point to release it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Meester Sushi is the _real_ star this time out, and "Let's Cruise" is sorta extrasupamutated electronic scr0nk, with an almost P-Funk groove and stab chords over lots of sliiiiding bass and syncopated percussion effects. So, it's a little bit like the Star Wars Cantina Band meeting Bootsy Collins at a LAN party, right? Riiiight.</description>
