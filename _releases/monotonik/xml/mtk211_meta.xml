  <description>A long time coming, the third Monotonik release from Chromatic Flights, aka Florida's Kyle Wyss, debuts after some heavy buzz for his main project, the two-man band Blind Man's Colour, online.

In fact, with none other than Kanye West linking his Blind Man's Colour material and the band &lt;a href="http://www.kaninerecords.com/artistpage.php?artist_id=22" rel="nofollow"&gt;signed to&lt;/a&gt; Kanine Records (Grizzly Bear, Mommy And Daddy), we're delighted to be continuing to put out his solo material for Monotonik fans.

Continuing from his first and second free releases on Monotonik, &lt;a href="http://www.archive.org/details/mtk184" rel="nofollow"&gt;'Memories From The Audible Color Wheel' and &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.archive.org/details/mtk200" rel="nofollow"&gt;'Heavy Stars Will Fall'&lt;/a&gt;, respectively, this new EP continues to layer in gorgeous mixes of shoegazing melodies and electronic goodness. We very much appreciate Kyle's support and patience.

(And on that front, note to Monotonik listeners - sorry we've been slowing down our output of late. Real life -- and the overwhelming amount of music available on the Internet -- has been intervening. We'll try to keep it going at a reasonable pace.)</description>
