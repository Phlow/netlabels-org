  <description>There's a lake at the bottom of Tim Koch's (DeFocus artist + Surgery 'label-boss') garden. And one day, when Tim was down there trawling for VST plug-ins, he found DJ Fish Finger, wedged under a big rock. [Oddly, DJ Fish Finger is also the shape, size and consistency of a fishfinger, which makes DJ-ing out surprisingly problematic, especially in frozen food stores.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This discovery turned out to be fortuitous, however, because whilst DJ Fish Finger was stuck there, he had been working on a 6-track EP of tunes utilising everything from weird jazz records to ethnic weird-o-ness, with a little moaning and Japanese people passing gas sneaked in too (think Mr.Scruff, but more looptastic?), and he passed them onto Tim. Who passed them onto us. And now we're passing them onto you. Weirdly karmic, isn't it?</description>
