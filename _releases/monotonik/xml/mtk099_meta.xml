  <description>We're proud to feature the debut release from Kaamos, the new artist name for the Finnish musician formerly known as Phonex. Under that moniker, he released some beautiful tracks on a split 10" with Sense for Lee Metamatics' Neo-Ouija Records, plus appearances on classy compilations for Merck, Suojain, and Neo-Ouija.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, he's been away for a while, revitalising and recuperating, and "Agony" is a gorgeous return to form for his new moniker, showcasing scatterbeat drums, robotic synth drills, and all that is good about the Scandinavian abstract electronics movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it's like imagining yourself on a boat in a river with Tom Baker punting, before you get sucked into a time vortex by a BBC strike and are caressed by Daft Punk-like robots with curiously warm metallic hands. With marmalade skies, too. Glad we sorted that one out. More of the ecstacy, less of the agony, really.</description>
