  <description>So, a long-awaited Monotonik solo debut from New Zealand's Michael Upton, aka Jet Jaguar, with the beautifully minimal, almost dub-infused electronica of his 'Biddy Bids' EP.

Having previously released physical CDs on Involve Records and Capital Recordings, as well as being one half of recent Monotonik releasers Malty Media - alongside Aquaboogie - Upton seems to revel in oddly clipped, funky stylings.

For example, lead track 'Red' is all echo-drums and spotty, static-flecked skank, while another standout, 'Enjoy Mask Aesthetic', is burbling synth backgrounds topped by a roving bassline of some repute. It all ends with 'Kent's Windchime Recording', which seems to mix ambient samples with pulsing, almost heartlike beats. Different is good!</description>
