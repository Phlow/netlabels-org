  <description>Sliding lithely out of Russia, we're delighted to present a split EP by Stanislav "Slam" Vdovin and Eugene Martynov, also known as &lt;a href="http://www.unit21.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;Unit21&lt;/a&gt;, with whom we've been talking to for some time after we met them through their friends, multiple Monotonik-releasers &lt;a href="http://www.stown.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sleepy Town Manufacture&lt;/a&gt;. Unit21's blend of beautifully understated, melody rich electronics is something to behold indeed, and we ended up settling on this small, but perfectly formed 2-track EP.

So, basically, we have 'Lain: I Care' by Unit21, leading off with a gorgeous ambient track, all floating and pirouetting and flexing its radiance at us, and STM bringing up the rear with 'Lain: Say You Care', a spattering, beat-flecked reply, again, marvellously melodic. This is the kind of EP we wish could go on for ever, but we'll settle for the infinite loop option - it actually makes sense, in a supportive, 'there for you' type way, we promise.</description>
