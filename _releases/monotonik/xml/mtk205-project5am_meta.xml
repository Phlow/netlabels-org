  <description>This time round, a Monotonik debut for Project 5am, aka Jason Haye, with the distinctly trippy 'Quixotes Of Moons Fight The Windmills Of Brixton'. Verging into deep house, electronic, and chillout, the full-length album is a delightful mix of trancelike and straightforward.

Starting out, we've got 'Angelou', all thudding guitars and phasing synths, before we move into 'Polar Stratospheric Clouds', chunked up sounds to the fore. Some of the other highlights include the swooshing, almost soundtrack-ish 'Crepuscular', and the echoing 'Ochanimizu'.

Overall, a delightful start, we fear - and something that will echo in our dreams for a good few months to come. Congratulations, Sir.</description>
