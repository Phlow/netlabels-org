  <description>It's good to come back to what you know, and we felt like UK artist &lt;a href="http://www.bracestower.co.uk" rel="nofollow"&gt;Braces Tower&lt;/a&gt;, previously member of the Wiija-signed, Radiohead-supporting, Peel Session-ing Loveblobs way back in the mists of time, was due another release on Monotonik with his delightful blend of sass, electronics, and intelligent sampledelica, since his first '&lt;a href="http://www.mono211.com/content/releases/m211mp28.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Pshhh EP&lt;/a&gt;' was so well received by all a year or two back. So we asked him nicely, and the round-up compilation 'Pasteism' is the unholy result.

So there's a great deal of diversity across the 8 tracks of 'Pasteism', from the opening, wonderfully languid meanderings of 'Action Jackson', seguing straight into the frantic skank of 'El Fuego' - and the hits just keep on coming from there. Some of the other highlights? Let's try the sophisticated jazz of 'Spelling Bee', the funky Sesame-ish groove of 'Eleven Twelve', and the ending, tremendously blissed out nu chill of 'Nameless'. We're not nameless, but we are speechless. </description>
