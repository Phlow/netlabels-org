  <description>To say we were blown away when we heard this one isprobably an understatement. Since we switched to mp3only, most m211 tunes use many of the advantages ofthat format, and this is a beautiful example (yehyeh, you can stop bitching now, MOD traditionalists!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, "Dance.." is an absolutely spectacular funkjamstraight outta the Dharma+Prob. studio-bunker in Helsinki. Dharma plays live bass and guitar on this one, and would also like to thank Panu Syrj√§nen for the wicked live tenor sax playing. On with the music, on with the show..?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, a further plug - as you might have heard, Dharmaand Prob. have a single out on the Audio Couturesublabel of Moving Shadow in just a few weeks - it'scalled "Soulwarrior" and it's by Dharma+Dice - we'veheard the tracks and they're the funkiest d+b you'veEVER heard, and that's official :) So don't forget to go buy the 12" at your local record emporium.</description>
