  <description>We return once more to the Monotonik fold with the mp3 debut from Hoffman, who's currently DJ-ing a number of techno nights in the SouthWest of England, and shows he still has the goods on the composition side, too, with this great piece of phasing minimal techno.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were initially thinking this didn't fit in with Monotonik-style, majestic though it is - but then we realised, of course it fits - Hoffman's a massive part of Mono (he had the first ever release, for one), and Monotonik's aim is simply to kick it with the electronic beatz - "Deep Impact" does that with ease.Comparisons? We're not so well-versed in that particular area, but the muffled-to-sharp funkiness of the bassdrum and hihats and the almost acid tube-bass make it sound a bit like a deeper, nastier Daft Punk, don't you think?</description>
