Another new artist that turned heads immediately at Monotonik HQ, the Swedish-based Henrik 'Bliss' Jose, has been releasing tracks on net.label Fairlight Music for a while now, and when he came to us with this lushly produced, vocal-dotted electronic track, originally composed back in 2001, we snapped it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Life On The Rooftop" starts out with some carefully placed organ, and segues into a full vocal-manipulated, densely produced track reminiscent of some of the earlier Super Science or Idmonster vocal experiments on Monotonik, and somehow cleaner and more glorious in its own right. In a search for electronica that sounds noticably different and strays from the same old norms, Bliss definitely comes up trumps.
