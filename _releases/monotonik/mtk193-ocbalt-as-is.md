A debut on Monotonik, then, for Finland-based electronic music artist Ocbalt, with some delightfully bubble, vocoded tracks from his upcoming 'Vintage Art' album.

The full album should be out on a physical label pretty soon, but we, luckily enough, get a digital EP to precede it, with the brief spoken word 'What Is Art?' seguing swiftly into the surprising bleep-pop of 'Bribe', which showcases sweet multi-tracked vocoded singing and super-catchy synths, all stutter-step.

The other two tracks are dead-on, too, with 'As Is' blasting a little tarantella on drums before spooky synths wander in and looped spaceman vocals wander across the top somewhere or other. Finally, 'Okno' has an odd spoken word loop to start out before some absolutely delightful idmpop wanders into view, catchy and smart. 'Ok yes', Ocbalt - and thanks for sharing with us.
