Monotonik is delighted to present a free, full six-track EP from Holland's Jasper Boer, aka Jap Jap, in the form of 'A Resonant Discovery', including a remix by Dutch artist Morgenfish. 

The EP consists of varied types of beautifully smooth idm pieces coupled with evolving melodic motifs, which go through different moods: from chillout ambient to more uptempo material. 

This showcases Jap Jap's signature style of solidly produced minimal yet melodic style of dance, which draws inspiration from dreampop, synthpop, postrock and electronica chill out genre artists Ulrich Schnauss and Manual.
