Though we've admired his work on the net.label Inpuj, plus current/forthcoming real.life releases on Merck and Saundart, we haven't had a chance to put out anything from US idm.artist Proswell.. until now, that is.

But "0EO", possibly named after a certain chip-tune related tracker-based command which you can hear used on the track, is a really enchanting piece of intelligently puttering idm-ness, again, sorta indescribable in its multiple layering and soaring subtle sounds, but a little reminiscent of the most delicate, sweetest artists around - Isan, Mum, BoC?

And when everything kicks in, "0EO" is like a slumber-filled tint on the kind of euphoria you got when you watched and listened to "Music Sounds Better With You", seeing a kid launching a glider off a grassy hill in the hazy summer heat, the beats looping and quietly endorphin-rushing over and over. Significantly, slinkily.. yum.
