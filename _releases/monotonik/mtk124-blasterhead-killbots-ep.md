Having been beguiled by the retro bleep sensibilities of Japanese videogame composer Akihiro Ito, aka <a href="http://www.blasterhead.com">Blasterhead</a>, ever since hearing some of his Nintendo GameBoy tracks via Osaka-based 'chiptune' meta-site <a href="http://vorc.org">Vorc.org</a>, we hunted him down, and the results of this predatory action come in the form of the wonderful GameBoy-based rave bleep release you see before you, 'Killbots EP'.

When he's not sneaking off for some GameBoy rave action, Blasterhead is sometimes sneaking GB sounds into <a href="http://www.lantis.co.jp/release/title/siritu_akihabara/index.html">the soundtracks</a> of the PC hentai dating games he provides music for, and is now providing music for (non-adult!) Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 versions of the (distinctly risque!) Kero-Q PC dating title <a href="http://www.elizar.com/showcase/moekan.htm">Moekko Company (Moekan)</a>, about 'an enigmatic man served unquestioningly by five beautiful maids with equally mysterious pasts.'

But we get the fruits of his Killbot spree, non-mysteriously and immediately, and the EP, originally released as a 500-copy limited-edition CD with the addition of a (non-included) live track, and largely composed with the homebrew Nintendo GameBoy music composition tool <a href="http://www.littlesounddj.com">LittleSound DJ</a>, starts with the almost robotic, percussively smart GameBoy romp of 'Skyblue Monday', before seguing into the sirens and pitch bends of the rave-like 'Killbots'. The rest of the EP is similarly sparkling, with 'We Are Here' a particular highlight, all intelligent repetition and danceable retro beats.
