We return once more to the Monotonik fold with the mp3 debut from Hoffman, who's currently DJ-ing a number of techno nights in the SouthWest of England, and shows he still has the goods on the composition side, too, with this great piece of phasing minimal techno.

We were initially thinking this didn't fit in with Monotonik-style, majestic though it is - but then we realised, of course it fits - Hoffman's a massive part of Mono (he had the first ever release, for one), and Monotonik's aim is simply to kick it with the electronic beatz - "Deep Impact" does that with ease.Comparisons? We're not so well-versed in that particular area, but the muffled-to-sharp funkiness of the bassdrum and hihats and the almost acid tube-bass make it sound a bit like a deeper, nastier Daft Punk, don't you think?
