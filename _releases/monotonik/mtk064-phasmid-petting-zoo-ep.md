For some reason, we sat on the demos Phasmid sent us for a few months. Then we listened again and smacked ourselves upside the head for not putting out the US idm-er's material, like, _immediately_. Why? It's the missing link Monotonik may have been needing, a bridge between laid-back traditional melodics and something a little more unconventional and new.

So, welcome to Phasmid's skewed world-view courtesy of "Heroine Of Goat Bells", all Plone-ish weird instruments and out-there multi-tracked melodies, moving on to "The Smallest Ghosts", which encompasses subtle klangs, crashes, and childlike leads, whilst "Cheeky50" finishes off in crazily mechanical style, all whistles, rattles, and wheezes. Gotta love the Phasmid style.
