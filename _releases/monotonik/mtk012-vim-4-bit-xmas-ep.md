Season's greetings from the Monotonik klan come in the form of this wonderful duo from Vim!, label-star and uniquely. unique artist. So we kick it with trademark retro melodies in "4-Bit Xmas" and then do some warped Arfur Daley-sampling breakwizardry with "Wakey Wakey Wales - It's Christmas!" If only Yuletide could always be as warped as this.
