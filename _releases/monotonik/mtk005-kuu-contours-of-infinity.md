Kuu, aka Substance, scores a majestic little piece of Monotonik-ness from the depths of his pure sinewaved soul. Beautifully drifting for most of it, the final couple of minutes change tack into a minor hailstorm of electronic noise. The sustain goes on forever.. just a really, serenely beautiful track. Comparisons are needed but not really forthcoming - perhaps a little like Luke Slater when he's being a little mellower? Who knows? Well, you do when you download it, we believe.
