"Skallberget" is Daniel Blomqvist's  debut release which has found a natural 
home at netlabel Autoplate.  Daniel has been experimenting with electronic 
music for 15 years - spending his leisure time  "sculpting melody, noise and 
beat to fit what ever mood I happen to be in."  The songs took their form in 
the Skallberget region of the Swedish city of Västerås where Daniel resides.  
Using a laptop, and being mainly a diversion, the songs were created  over an 
extended period of time during the late evenings in the living room of his 
home which he occupies together with his girlfriend.   

Daniel's music is personal and emotive being inspired by events or moments in 
life and serving as a reflection of his mood. His music is varied, drawing its 
inspiration from several genres, although, ambient seems to be especially 
significant to "Skallberget".  The ambiance of "Skallberget" is smooth and 
harmonious - born of carefully selected sounds and samples and then 
meticulously sculptured into poignant soundscapes that are perfectly suited 
for nighttime listening - so you'll not find anything coarse or overtly 
dissonant here. 

The ties that bind these songs, that is, those qualities that give 
"Skallberget" its sense of cohesiveness, are the underlying  ambient backdrop 
working in unison with the compelling emotional connections behind each song . 
Other musical styles are also at play here which are clearly intertwined 
within the aural fabric of "Skallberget".  "När Andra Sover" and "Själdestruktiv" 
are dub-inspired soundscapes with the former being minimal and sparse while 
latter is slightly more robust and dense.  The misty electronics, beautiful 
melodies, and clear traces of pop-influences on "Juninatt", "Cement Och Glas", 
and "Frost" suggest some comforting pastoral moments.  As alluded to in their 
titles, the melancholic melodies and hazy, static minimalism of "Risk För Ras" 
and "Midnatt Råder" hint at a late night urban landscape bringing to mind 
images of dimly lit, deserted streets.  A blend of conversational voices, 
piano samples, and warm orchestral ambience on "Tjuvlyssnat" allow for a homey, 
nostalgic mood.
