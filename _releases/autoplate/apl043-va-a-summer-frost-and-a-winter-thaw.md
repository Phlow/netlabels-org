In May 2004 and then again in June 2006, Arrial brought two reflective,
emotional and melodic albums to netlabel Autoplate by way of "This is My
Beauty, Show Me Yours" [APL026] and "For the Love" [APL038] and now, almost
one year since the latter, we find seven Autoplate artists offering
remixes/remakes of songs selected from these albums in a new release titled
"A Summer Frost And A Winter Thaw".

As slightly alluded to in the title of the album, Arrial comments that the
tracks when taken as a whole invoke the idyllic image of a nearly deserted
tropical beach with a fringe of palm trees, an unoccupied hammock, and a
close by path leading to a some kind of dwelling, but this relaxing scene is
given a surreal hue as the entire landscape is covered with a light dusting
of snow. The visual image of this pleasantly incongruous landscape is
further deepened by the remixes themselves as each artist captures the
spirit of the original track to varying degrees while at the same
constructing something different. Some of the remixes have a philosophical
motif that defines their design while others have been approached from a
more realistic/technical slant. It's this amazing creative ability of
capturing samples of the original sounds, carefully processing them, and, in
some cases, combining these with new sounds/samples and ideas particular to
the artist, and then reassembling them into a new creation retaining the
quintessence of the original song that makes remixing a rich and rewarding
artistic endeavor. Lou Teti summarizes the remixes quite nicely: "One
interesting thing that is underlined by these remixes is the extent to which
even the same person, with the same starting point can end in such a
different place with a just a slightly different approach. "

Daniel Blomqvist starts the album by finding the melodies behind Arrial's
guilt-tinged "Tomorrow I Start My Homework" so enjoyable that he ended up
preserving much of the song's original makeup. Tailored slightly to give it
a more of a Daniel Blomqvist-ish sound, Daniel decreased the tempo somewhat
and added effects and noise. Describing it as "a great pop-tune to begin
with", Daniel's remix transforms it into more of an pop-flavored ambient
piece.

The Lou Teti Backtalk mix is a second version of his remix (thus titled 
the "backtalk mix") and is a sassy tune with attitude that is truer to 
the sound of the original track. By keeping the melodic progression  
close to the original and by limiting the amount of editing applied to 
the original sounds, this remix retains the more of the flavor of Arrial's 
version, including the addition of acoustic guitar parts (as opposed to 
the electric guitar used in the former) which allows this version to 
better reflect Arrial's approach.

Off the Sky (Jason Corder) also remixed "Bitch, where's the guns?" . While
enjoying all of Arrial's tracks, Jason selected this particular song to
remix in good part because of its title, finding "something humorously
ironic" about it. Jason used a lot of natural instruments in creating his
remake, especially his own vocal chords because he feels that "the human
element gives the music a more palatable, human touch." Jason's rework
clearly walks the border of something noticeably darker and more somber than
its counterparts on the remix album and, like Lou Teti's first remix, it
also took on a life of its own.

Fernando Lagreca gives his "predictable glitch" remix of Arrial's "I Predict
a Quiet" (Arrial's poignant version the Kaiser Chief's classic " I Predict a
Riot") a personal touch by combining Flamenco-like guitar phases with subtle
textures of glitch and by reflecting the excitement and melancholy of the
South-Spanish spirit. He likens his remix to the "lament of a Gipsy robot"
suggesting the peculiar image of robot with a guitar on a deserted beach
calling for quiet.

Konrad Bayer's remix of "Marpaksses" (Arrial's song about the energy and
passion accompanying the never-ending cyclic game of desire and pursuit) is
a blurred image of the original. Melancholic and fragile, but in a positive
way, this remix contains samples of field recordings from the Korean island
of Bogil-do which became the home of the poet Yun Sun-Do (1587-1671) who
became stranded there during a storm and loved it so much that he ended up
staying for ten years. His poems are renown for their simplicity and beauty,
qualities that Konrad hopes that he brings to his works.

In the original release notes Arrial commented that "Blank Holiday Monday"
was "about feeling dazed after a particularly heavy night" and lying around
on couch or in a hammock "watching the day go by." Emil Klotzsch's version
does a particularly good job of retaining this bemused atmosphere. His remix
uses only samples from the original song which are then transformed "so that
there are still glimpses of the original" but to Emil it's "more important
to create something new with old material."

Gultskra Artikler's take on Arrial's "Farewell Again" ends up being more of
a new track than a remix by comparison. Blending samples of Arrial's version
with some signature Gultrskra Artikler sounds, this affecting song about
loss and renewal takes on a life of its own and comes out being more
accurately described as a remake.

So here they are presented to you for your listening pleasure, five of
Arrial's thoughtful, affecting, and harmonious songs remixed, remade, and
reinterpreted by seven exceptional Autoplate artists.
