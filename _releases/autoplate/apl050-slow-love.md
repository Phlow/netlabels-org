"I think when you put a lot of true emotions into your music it becomes 
psychedelic and hypnotic, because you believe in your sound, you just live in 
it and every sample or synth is your friend with his own life."

After a hiatus of over a year, the final Autoplate release sees the debut of
russian artist Slow. Once we received his demo during the summer we knew right
away that we found the perfect soundtrack for the funeral of Autoplate - we're 
very happy to give life to the project "Slow" and at same time wave goodbye to
our friends and supporters.
