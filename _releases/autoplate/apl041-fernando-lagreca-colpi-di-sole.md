Anyone who has followed Autoplate since its beginnings knows that Fernando 
Lagreca is no stranger to the label's diverse lineup of artists. Following the 
releases of "Suave" (2003) and "Nadador" (2005), Fernando makes an impressive 
third appearance on netlabel Autoplate with "Colpi di Sole". Identifying 
"Nadador" along with "Funicular" (RealAudio, 2005), as his favorite albums, 
Fernando decided that it would be difficult to surpass their creative quality 
and made the decision to take some time off in order to mull over some fresh 
ideas for his next release. In April 2006, he began making a sketch of the new 
album and over a period of about two months the ten tracks found on "Colpi di 
Sole" were born. 

Love is the simple theme of that so complex emotion of this newest Autoplate 
release. "Colpi di Sole" is an Italian expression that translates into "hit of 
sun" which is linked to the reassuring warmth that is often associated with 
love and romance - what Fernando describes as a musical encryption of joy and 
pleasure and a reflection of melancholic affection. The heartening sounds found 
within the ten tracks embracing "Colpi di Sole" are a magical blend of processed 
acoustic guitar, hardware synthesizers, vocoder processed vocals, along with 
both sampled and programmed rhythms/beats. Although a bit awkward, a one line 
pr√©cis of what s the listener will hear on "Colpi di Sole" might be - Suave, 
love-inspired, glitch-textured electronic-acoustic vocal-instrumental 
pop-ambient. 

"Andana" is the romantic opener relating the story of his attraction to a girl 
that used to ride the daily train with him. Lightly processed acoustic guitar, 
electronic glitches, delicate beats, and smoothly wavering sythns form the 
backdrop as vocoder processed vocals recount the story. The romantic tone 
continues with the dreamy title track. "Colpi di Sole" is about what happens 
when you are in love. Tenderly plucked guitar notes, melancholic keyboards, 
subtle beats, and soft, processed vocals all meld together to narrate this 
second romantic tale. Leaving the vocals behind briefly, the up tempo "Drone 
Girl" is an elated sounding, pop-inspired instrumental composition full of rich 
acoustic guitar chords and rhythms made even more listenable by its intricate 
beats. Mellowing things down once again, the nostalgic "Red Sun Hair" is a 
vocal piece telling of a weekend love story. Near the album's midpoint "Tanto 
Amore" (So Much Love) brings a short instrumental interlude within which 
effortless guitar playing and synthesizer melodies seem to be carrying on a 
passionate conversation. The second half of the album begins with the down 
tempo "What We Call Love", a love song full of relaxed melodies and processed 
vocals and a refrain that reminds us "that's what we call love." A rich, 
lyrical composition, "Trip Elisa" is about the girl that we all dream of 
meeting. Wistful vocals and a simple, melancholic keyboard melody stand out 
against a beautiful rhythmic background of flowing chord progressions and 
gentle beats. A deep, solitary synthesizer-based loop establishes the 
downhearted mood of "Bad Day for a Robot" as a patchwork of toy-like noises 
and glitches dart in and out among sad melodies and acoustic guitar rhythms 
begging the question "why a robot couldn't have a bad day?" As the album nears 
its conclusion, "Tillbaka", a Swedish word meaning "behind", elivers a 
nostalgic, harmonious assemblage of blurred vocals, synthesized melodies, and 
acoustic guitar described by Fernando as "what is behind the life, the travels, 
the people." "Colpi di Sole" reaches its quixotic conclusion with orchestral-
like ambience of "Tramuntana" constructed of smooth melodies, warm acoustic 
rhythms and soft beats of which Fernado says "it is the wind from the 
mountains ... from the Pyrenees. Fresh and strong, but calid and soft at the 
very same time."
