This first Autoplate release of 2007 simply titled "Holzlaub" is the result of 
a fortuitous meeting between two Cologne-based artists who share a passion for 
electronic music.  Emil Klotzsch is an established artist with well-received 
netlabel releases on the One netlabel ["Sandkorn" (2005) and "Feinquisit" 
(2006)] and a remarkable previous appearance on Autoplate in 2006 with his 
cinematic ambient album "Tiefe Berge".  Raimund Sudermann is a talented, 
emerging artist making his netlabel debut.   An email from Raimund to Emil 
regarding his liking of the "Sandkorn" album revealed that Raimund was also 
"doing some sounds himself" and, in Raimund's words,  the idea of a 
"spontaneous appointment for jamming" arose. It was these ongoing series of  
"jamming" sessions that formed the foundation of "Holzlaub".

Symbolic of the organic atmosphere emerging from these recordings, the album 
title "Holzlaub" translated literally means "Wooden Leaves", and the song 
titles themselves are the Latin names of trees which had bloomed as the songs 
were being created.    At its core, "Holzlaub" is a blend of sampled 
classical-style guitar sounds (and other chance noises) as improvised by 
Raimund along with the deliberate sharing and processing of these samples via 
synchronized PowerBooks where intuition and feelings were important 
ingredients.  In addition, the congenial atmosphere of Raimund's apartment in 
which most of these songs were conceived and took their final form, is sure to 
have contributed to the organic ambiance that is clearly prevalent.

The five songs comprising "Holzlaub" can be appreciated on dual listening 
planes.  First, they can be listened to at a distance, that is to say, letting 
the sounds blend into the natural background ambiance formed by other 
environmental sounds and goings on.  On the other hand, they can be also be 
enjoyed close-up by tuning out all other sounds and distractions and simply 
relishing the specific minutiae that each song reveals independent of all 
other happenings. 

Key to understanding fully the richness and flavor "Holzlaub" is having a 
knowledge of how the songs came to be. Raimund and Emil both shared these 
important details.  Each jam session began with Raimund playing for a few 
minutes on acoustic guitar which Emil describes as "doing improvisations or 
noises, just every sound the guitar is good for." A microphone captured not 
only the guitar sounds and other random noises as they occurred  but also 
the aural properties specific to the room itself, which were then recorded.  
Using PowerBooks, each artist manipulated the samples to his liking  and, 
in some cases, the sounds were edited to the extent that they no longer 
resembled those  produced by a guitar.  It was from these manipulated 
samples that the songs began to develop.  In a simultaneous manner, each 
artist previewed the processed sounds and, if satisfied, sent them to 
monitoring speakers so that the other could listen, modify, and even add 
his own sounds as his instincts so directed. In the fashion, the music 
continued to build and evolve.  At some point the artists stopped and 
discussed what sounds should be dismissed and which should tentatively become 
a part of the final song arrangement.  Once the individual parts were 
determined, the final arranging of the song began via live capture of both 
artists doing metaimprovisions, that is, new improvisions of those same 
improvised electro-acoustic sound parts that had been mutually agreed upon 
before. These last improvisions, which often ran in excess of thirty minutes, 
were then whittled down to more acceptable lengths to create the final song.

In addition to the intricacies of the making of "Holzlaub", also important 
to its appreciation are the many influences, musical or otherwise, that have 
contributed to Emil's and Raimund's present states of artistic development.  
While some of these influences are overt and easily identified,  others are 
implicit - embedded in the music -  and not easily discernable, if at all.
