Herwig Holzmann, co-founder of netlabel Laridae, has been composing electronic 
music for about seven years.  Now, after releasing music as Macon Tights and 
Photophob, he graces netlabel Autoplate with an album under his own name 
blending ambient atmospheres with gentle beats and warm melodies by way of 
“How to Stop...“

Working as Macon Tights, Herwig describes his initial albums as “mixtures of 
gloomy pieces of drum & bass and dreamy IDM tunes“ consisting of a multitude 
of “destroyed, altered, and rearranged“ audio samples.  Later he changed his 
alias to Photophob, invested in some new software and hardware, and his sound 
began to evolve into something “warmer, less dirty, and more complex.“ His 
work as Photophob ranges from laid-back IDM to drill n‘ bass/break-beat to 
“slowed down, repetitive, ambient“ compositions,  and, as even the most cursory 
listening will reveal, it‘s to this latter category that the sounds of 
“How to Stop...“ belong.

Herwig describes his method of making music as “musical storytelling“ - 
soundtracks for nonexistent movies.  He wants listeners to create their own 
stories and images in their minds as they listen to what he describes as his 
pieces of “audio fiction.“  Most often when he creates a new track he begins 
with a hazy idea of the mood that he wants to establish and then instinctively 
generates sounds and rhythms that converge on that idea.  The titles of the 
tracks, the artwork, and any samples used are as integral to his albums as the 
music itself.  It‘s this network of ideas, sounds, and other parameters that he 
attaches to an album that allows its listeners to create his/her own mental 
picture (such as a story, a film, a painting, etc.) by association. As Herwig 
puts it: “My albums are intended as balanced dramaturgical stories, the tracks 
are the chapters.“ His approach to ambient is akin to that of Console‘s “Mono“ 
album or artists of the likes of Biosphere similar in style to the“ Scandinavian“ 
approach of smooth ambiance and sounds full of warmth and crackle.  

In summarizing the album, Herwig says that “How to Stop...“ is about enjoying 
the immediate moment and taking pleasure in the beauty that our minds can bring 
into existence. It‘s “about stopping short, about pressing the pause-button of 
life and stepping out of the notional restrictions that our stressed out life‘s 
put on thinking and perception.“  From a technical viewpoint, “How to Stop...“ 
is an ambient complement to various complex rhythmic and beat-oriented releases 
that he has been working on concurrently.  These ambient counterparts (of which 
“How to Stop...“ is an prime example) focuses more so  on “calmed down soundscapes 
and repetitive structures.“

So learn how to stop ... and press the pause-button of life for a few moments, 
breaking away from the daily routine long enough to let your psyche  savor this 
new album of “audio fiction.“ Let these eleven ambient-leavened story-songs stir 
your mind and soul with over an hour‘s worth of mellow beats and serene melodies.
