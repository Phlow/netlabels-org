It's been over two years since Jason Corder last appeared on Autoplate with 
his "Caustic Light" EP [APL033].  Now he's back with this single track teaser 
release to prepare us for his upcoming Autoplate album.  Composing as Off the 
Sky, Jason is recognized for his unique style of experimental, atmospheric 
ambient music that is often visually inspired,  taking images of his natural 
surrounding and transforming them into affecting, sonic metaphors of reality.

"Cumulae Movement"  revolves around the formation of a well-known weather 
phenomenon  know as cumulous clouds.  According to Jason he wanted to "create a 
movement of sound that mimicked the nature of these billowy, slow, 
shape-shifting atmospheric giants. So this rather long, dense piece simulates 
the time that Jason spent watching the clouds slowly progress across his field 
of view.

As a cumulous cloud moves across the sky, its shape is constantly changing, 
taking on several different forms during its life cycle.   Likewise, as you 
listen, you?ll find that "Cumulae Movement" is an evolving piece consisting of 
several distinct parts that are interconnected by the same general motif.

As Jason related to me, this long composition was made "to be listened to on a 
sunny day while watching an entire cloud from birth to death across the span of 
one's view while sitting and watching it in one direction.  So find a natural 
location - an open field, a lake, a beach, a secluded hill or mountain - and 
enjoy this beautiful, placid ambient symphony.
