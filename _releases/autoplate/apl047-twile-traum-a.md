Twile, whose real name is Jarmo Huhta, is a Finnish, Helsinki-based musician 
with an MA in ethnomusicology.  Having composed music for art exhibitions and 
theater and following a previous appearance on the Comatronic netlabel with his 
well-received “Chiaroscuro” EP (2005) described in the liner notes as 
dub-inspired and “saturated with sadness”,  his debut on netlabel Autoplate 
brings to its listeners his own poignant and unique blend of dubtech and 
electronica. 

The album title was selected for its dual meaning - “Traum” is the German word 
for “dream” while “trauma” refers to emotional injury or suffering as a result 
of experiencing an extremely stressful situation or physical injury.  
The sounds are cinematic, designed to be listened to in seclusion, and the 
album as a whole is a manifestation of  Twile’s belief that “what is contained 
in sadness holds the greatest potential for joy.” So Twile, as if assuming the 
role of a therapist, summons the misplaced world of dreams, childhood, and 
forest to offer a “sonorous  cure.”

“Traum-a” reveals what Twile identifies as his four obsessions: filtered 
violin, glitch sounds, dub bass lines, and contemplative melodies.  Going 
beyond standard dubtech, the tracks contain definite and extended harmonic 
arrangements.  The first half of the album builds on the “four-to-the-floor” 
beat pattern while the second half relies on a more relaxed, less defined 
rhythmic structure.  There’s a persistent, melancholic ambiance maintained 
throughout the album.  Amongst these four songs one will find introspective, 
reverberating melodies conveying a sense of space and distance, violin samples 
bringing an undeniable layer of sadness, traces of glitch adding texture, and 
subtle beats and bass lines providing a solid rhythmic structure.  Especially 
notable on “Sedna” are beautiful vocal fragments by Milja (Naava Projekt) 
exuding a human touch of pathos.
