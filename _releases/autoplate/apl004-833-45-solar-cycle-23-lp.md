Vancouver based artist Kevin Krebs who is known through his Notype.com & Nishi output is known for working on a very own kind of sound exploration and searching for the yet most exciting frequencies between the various radiostations out there on earth. "Solar Cycle" creates a very cold and inhuman atmosphere, partly post-nuclear when the test signals in "A Perfectly Reflecting Earth" evoke.

Through the continued slightly distorted whitenoise Kevin unfolds his advanced beatshuffling with merging layers and bits of radio signals with sinesaws and delayed DSP fx. The imagery of wasteland is pervasively reflected in the calm pieces of this album, for example through the incomplete transmissions in "A Layer Of Silence" and "11075 kHz". This album has a filmic touch i think and is best listened to when having an evening with "The Andromeda Strain" or "The Day After".
