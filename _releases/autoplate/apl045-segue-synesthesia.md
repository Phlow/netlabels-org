Retaining in his guise as Segue, Jordan Sauer makes a welcome second appearance
on  netlabel Autoplate. "Synesthesia"  follows his impressive and well 
received August 2006 release "Forest Refractions" (APL039) which was described 
as a "moody collection of dub-inspired beats and ambient-dub soundscapes." 

The album's title ties in with Jordan's belief in music's capability "to 
provoke so many different emotions not commonly encountered in other sensory 
experiences â€¦ ."  The title "Synesthesia" was chosen after learning about a 
neurological condition of the same name which is the involuntary, atypical 
blending of bodily senses in which the stimulation of one sense causes the 
concurrent activation of one or more other senses such as hearing a color, 
tasting a word, or seeing a smell.  More relevant to this new album, it relates 
to the union of the auditory and visual senses in art as demonstrated in the 
work of expressionist painters like Wassily Kandinsky (and other like-minded 
artists) who associated tones and chords with colors as he painted.  

Jordan finds his music difficult to describe because it's so often a reflection 
of his emotions during the creative process.  The listener, in a different 
emotional state, might come away with a completely different impression of the 
sounds.  While he personally finds the tracks on this album by and large "warm 
and comforting",  others might find them a little chilly and tinted with an air 
of mystery.  The melody and beats used on "Synesthesia" are minimal, but there 
are many clever variations present to make the sounds interesting, pleasing, 
and entertaining 

The album begins with a duo of relaxed, but deep, dub tracks. Despite a day of 
tension and noise, Jordan regards "Ah, the Light Shines In" as an aural 
metaphor of "positive emotion" inspired by rays of sun light shining in through 
a window during a late winter day.  This is followed by the self-descriptive 
"Artic Air Dub" whose inspiration arose as a result of a period uncommonly cold 
London weather.  It's a "chilly, slow dub" with a "simple chiming melody" 
fashioned from a sample of vibrating wine glasses. 

The middle third of the album arrives with the more rhythmic dub and Reggae 
influenced "Dready."  A clearly discernable filtered hi-hat, heavy doses of 
delay and reverberation, and a laptop interface combine to give a nice imitation 
of a conventional dub mix. This is followed by "Deep in the Forest"  which 
Jordan aptly depicts as "a rainy adventure deep in the rainforest." A layer of 
discreet hiss and crackle do indeed give the impression of a wet, leafy ambiance 
and the delay and reverb give a sense of space and distance. The main ingredients 
of this song are "grainy textures, re-pitched piano chords, and a heavy bass" 
coupled  with a "prominent beat".   

The closing third of the album brings the listener into more ambient territory. 
"July" carries with it an euphoric atmosphere which Jordan says is analogous to  
"the feeling of a well-spent summer day at the beach."  Dissimilar frequencies, 
high and low, bring both contrast and stability to this song.  Appending nicely 
to "July" is the inviting and melodious track fittingly titled "Amber"  
characterized by Jordan as  a "warm, glitchy piece" centered around a hub of 
"layers of simple rhythmic patterns built with sine waves and filters."
