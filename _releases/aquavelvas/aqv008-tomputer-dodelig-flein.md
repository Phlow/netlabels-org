Hard-hitting and fleshed out, yet carefully controlled; that is some of the vibes the jazz / funk / electronika fusion “Glad uten kryp” brings to mind in this diverse release from The Tomputer.

In a radical departure from the opener, “Fred” is simple and clean, yet a beautiful and soothing piece. Peaceful indeed (“fred” is the Norwegian word for “peace”). The closing track puts on some deep space reggae vibes in a kind of hypnotic (or perhaps hallucinogenic?) way. Just let your mind drift for a while until the almost Blade Runner-ish trumpets signals the end.
