The debut release from sickmoth covers new ground for The Aquavelvas. Not conforming to any genre, he blends electronika and rock to great effect on this three-track collection. There is a distinct (or perhaps indistinct) otherworldly quality to these compositions that really can take you places if you let them.

Perhaps “Damaged” is the dreamiest with its soothing reverbed piano and sounds going in all four directions. This is far from an all laid back release though. “Seasons” must be one of the hardest tracks we have ever released, with all things distorted, and vocals on top.
