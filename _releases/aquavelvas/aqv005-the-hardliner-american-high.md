Our favourite Swiss artist since Yello is back with a carefree, unashamed single in perfect touch with the summer vibe, like it might have been some 20 years ago.

Picture yourself as that guy / girl in the game Outrun, cruising in your Testarossa while blasting American High on the stereo. :) The b-side takes you back even further, and brings to mind bands like The Human League and early Depeche Mode with its joyous, synthetic disco-pop sound.
