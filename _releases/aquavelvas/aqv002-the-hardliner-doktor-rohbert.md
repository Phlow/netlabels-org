In "Doktor Rohbert" it's all seemingly upbeat and happy at first, but towards the end of the track you can hear the suppresed desperation bursting out, showing that a computer generated voice indeed can express emotion. After months of unanswered calls for help, the feeling turns into helplessness and isolation in Roleks' atmospheric "Isolasjonsmiks". "The Kids Are Outraged" is another melancholic piece, but far less bleak. Its warm melodies and atmosphere leaves a feeling of optimism.
