Open up for some experimental stuff. Angst i Senga EP is a cooperative effort from Espen Davidsen and Skarv two old friends from Norway's electronica capital of old, Troms√∏. "I am Igloo" is surprisingly catchy, with a jazz-feel to it. Next up is the otherworldly and hypnotic "Space". "Mine lilla Truser" is more of a calming down-to-earth effort, but elegantly takes off again towards the end. On the last track, "Vaskeekte", is where it really gets experimental...
