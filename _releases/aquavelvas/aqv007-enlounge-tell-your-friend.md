"Tell Your Friend" is a release full of contrasts, but still it manages to stay perfectly chilled, as we have come to expect from enLounge. "Morning Espresso" must be one of the sexiest tracks we have released so far, with its soothing, floating mood and soulful vocals.

"I Feel Good" is more of a reggae/dub affair with some elements of funk thrown in for the usual good measure, while "We Got M16" shoots off some hard-hitting breakbeats, launching our first ever drum n' bass track, before lush pads and a nice and floating bassline smoothens it into a really moody piece of the old school. Enjoy :)
