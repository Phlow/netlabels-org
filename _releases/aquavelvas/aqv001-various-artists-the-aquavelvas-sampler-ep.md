Our first release is a compilation featuring tracks from all our artists. We feel this release should have something for everyone, and will give you a good introduction to The Aquavelvas.

Tune in to the inventive, jazz-inspired grooves of "Maaske Kraake", recall the lost science of 8bit melodies with "Illuminated Advertising in Space", get up and dance to the funky "Kremet Bernaise", take a mindtrip with the multiparted "LSD-Ninja" and rock the ice cold breakbeat of "Waiter". Enjoy.
