After a much prolonged summer holiday, we are finally back with a new release. This time it's Skarv who's got some pretty extravagant stuff on his hands.

"Lekker Dessert" is an atmospheric, progressive piece with a melody that really sticks to your brain. "MÃ¸te med Kopimaskin" takes a different direction, and breaks up the mood from the first track in a metallic, vocoded fashion, with some seriously strange lyrics backed by a driving beat. "Dead Ahead" brings back the cinematic feel of the opener, but in a darker, more organic flavour, reminiscent of a chilling winter night.
