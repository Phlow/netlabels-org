The Wonders of Spring

From the beginnings of human tradition, there has been a belief in spiritual beings, interacting with our world in shape of fairies or dwarves. These sprites, according to many legends, show up most vividly when nature seems to work on its bloom, in the early hours of the day, and mostly then in springtime. In curiosity about the fantastic scenes we observe we set up a hike in search for the wonders of nature. What we come to find in wandering around is astonishing in any case.
