Technocratical Correctness

Bremen-based Dj and Producer Thomas Bornemann comes along with his debut release on Stadtgruen. With four Detroit-rooted tracks, always funky with a touch of digital jazz and soul, Thomas gives an impression of that what he thinks electronic music is about. Base elements of his tracks are driving chords combined with 'usual' parts of a classic techno track, though still exciting. All that is 'Suggestion Box'.

Presenting four tracks for the dancefloor, the EP includes a remix by his 'partner in crime' alias 'Leptomorph' who joined him and his new label 'Sorbitol Records'. Already receiving good response and support by heroes as Claude Young, Pacou, WJ Henze, Andreas Kauffelt and others, this release has big potential to hit the urban clubscene in late 2004.
