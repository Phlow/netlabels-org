A Global Phenomenon

A park is a system within a system, a place of more or less exotic things concerning respective topics like nature, fauna or exploration, a place for individuals to get in touch with unusual forms+figures which are not present in their daily life. Visiting a park always means expanding his own horizon and perhaps sometimes reaching another level of existence and understanding.
