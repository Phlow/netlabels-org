Application and Evolvement

When Martin Müller and Holger Flinsch in 2006 decided to put their sounds and ideas together, their vision quickly developed into a complex suite of different motifs and tempers - all connected, all contributing to the striking organic eigenleben of the composition.

The concept of evolving derivation is now furthered in this compilation. Eleven artists — including some acquaintances of Stadtgruen — took on samples of the original track, altering and shifting them around to create completely new impressions out of the same material. A newly arranged Dubsuite.
