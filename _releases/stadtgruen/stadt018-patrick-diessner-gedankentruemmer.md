Straying Fractions

Suddenly this thought popps into your head and you realize - the melody this children is humming would perfectly match the track I have abandoned earlier ... I forgot again to buy milk ... Oh shit, Christmas is too near again ...

Sometimes it seems like we have all the facts that assemble our world permanently present and at the same time we lost most of them in the depths of our own awareness unreachable. They pop up incidentally, mostly when you don't think of them and when it's very much not the right time.

If it weren't like that, we would have to decide again and again what's important for the moment and what's not.

Taking things for granted is an amazing ability we should make ourselves aware of.
