Slurping Cocktails

Since the cold season is pushing spring more and more forth this year, we are forced to restrain our need for warmth and lightness a bit. By doing so, one thing we can do is to bath in remembrance of the warmer days in earlier years, always anticipating those to return within the next few moments.

'Retro Moods' plays with exotic and fresh elements, lively rhythmic structures and moving melodies - arranged in a great cocktail to an impressive symphony somewhere between House, Techno and Trance. We just have to say: take a sip and move your hip!
