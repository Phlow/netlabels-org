Balanced Antagonism

It might be the state before or after civilization. We slip into a green ambience. Surrounded by little creatures we walk through higher grass. Dark electronic sounds frighten us, but everything is in an harmonic stability. Do we strife through a primeval forest or trapped into an adventure game?

Gate Zero surprises with a smooth and calm releases which convinces by its balance: between natural and electronic sounds, between almost romantic harmonies and weird insertions. Major and minor at the same time, floating into each other on the same level, and merging beyond rightness. While listening we drift into a state of self-absorption and we can see clearly our path in this green world: We have to slow down to give all creatures and things their own place and time. Then, everything will have its inner truth beyond the antipodes.
