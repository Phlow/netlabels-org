Stories In Front Of Your Eyes

In modern society, people more and more tend to see technology as something given. Because of the huge degree of specialization they are unable to understand the manufacturing processes and therefore unable to connect to any of the things they eat, wear or use in everyday life. Many of them are involved in production of one certain item, but they do not care whether they are getting their money for producing a tire or a coffee cup. 

Since nobody cares of his result, when other people buy these coffee cups and put them into their offices nobody regards it as an item of personal value. As there mostly remain no further signs of human individuality but these functional objects no one is trained to see, people get even more depressed about their work - a necessarily big part of their life - and get the feeling of being replaceable, small parts of a system that somehow developed to work automatically.

As there is no new land to be discovered on earth and no further space to escape to, there is no other way of improving our quality of life than by discovering our immediate surrounding. We will have to take a close look at all the details of urban and global living and decide, which of the systems of our predecessors work and which have to be built anew. Most important of all, we will have to understand that all social systems are just based on convention and we are able and obligated to change them.
