Unchilled Temper

I'm at the shore. Music is circling in my ears. Friendly people, I catch a few hispanic words, barely dressed sexy chicks are crossing my path. Plashing water, the sun burns while a refreshing sip of water is running down my throat. Laziness extending, contentment.

After we caught a glimpse of the first warm sunbeams of late winter and early spring in Eastern Europe and Germany, we move straight to the wide and warm shores of Argentina's capital Buenos Aires.

As Argentina is located on the southern hemisphere, the temperature isn't too hot at the moment, though - it's already late autumn here and July will be the coldest month of the year, which is quite hard to imagine for people in the northern hemisphere.

Nevertheless, the temper of South American culture seems to be never tempering and the Argentinian autumn brings us music as hot as European summer days.
