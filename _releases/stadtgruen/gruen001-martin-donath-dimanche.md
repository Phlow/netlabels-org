Une Journée Calme En Été

'Dimanche' (Sunday) is the most important day of the week on which you should forget about your workday problems and worries, and just lay back and enjoy your life. Working every week under the pressure of the society, sunday is reserved for everyone to recreate.

Especially in summer this isn't as easy as it sounds, because the heat is doing everyone. After the really hot summer in 2003 'Dimanche' is anticipating to the upcoming hot days this year, which will apparently last quite long like the year before.

So instead of suffering under the heat you should remember the lovely moments summer brings to you, like a calm bask on the veranda, slurping a cool cocktail, enjoying a fresh breeze and being surrounded by barely dressed sexy chicks.

All that makes your summer.
