  <description>k.m.krebs is meanwhile a well known artist in the spaces of netaudio. he made music for notype, nishi and autoplate. his music often leads to hyperreal states, somewhere attached between here and there. you would find his music in places where people don't have a physical presence. between land, shore and void. 833-45 works with lots of noises and speech or other footage that comes along by radio or other remote sources.
k.m.krebs also runs his own netlabel nishi, that carries a colorful mixture of various music styles.

the deadfire ep was inspired by dead / dying stars. it is a very intense mixture between harsh and scapish. between stange and isolated. between free and soulful. "with my recent work as 833-45 i'm trying to be a little more free in my ideas. i used to stick to a very particular aesthetic, but now i let myself wander a lot more." (k.m.krebs)

deadfire is an exlusive work for 2063.</description>
