  <description>Ruben D'Hers: self-taught venezuelan musician who has developed a special taste for avant-garde music, exploring in a personal and different way the performance of his main instrument: the guitar. Blending it with colors of instruments like piano and violin, which have expanded his possibilities and resources at the time of composing. D'Hers' music could be framed in different genres (or influences), such as electroacustic and contemporary music with rock and free-jazz, but understanding that music speaks for itself.

'todo est√° en descanso' (translated: 'everything is in rest') is a compilation of compositions recorded between 1999 and 2004.
