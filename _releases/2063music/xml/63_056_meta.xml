  <description>This is a tribute to the exellent movie "THX1138" from George Lucas. The movie was re-released in 2004 on DVD as a directors cut. A totalitarian state is controlling humans. They got drugs to work and function and all has been cared for the people. They live in incredible white and minimal cityscapes. The characters THX1138 and LUH3417 try a escape.

Phoenelais intention was to give the movie a more positive soundtrack. This is the first time he worked with loops and the soundscapes are as usual brilliant pieces of droney, electronic listening music. Also go and buy a copy of the movie. It is a must have seen for every 2063music fan.</description>
