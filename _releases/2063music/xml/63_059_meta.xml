  <description>"When I write code, then it had to be quiet, the night is best. But when I make music than everything must be on: the people in the street, the tv, everything", said Kazooo last night via instant messaging. We were preparing this release and really put some work into it. "The Ramp" is an ep where kazooo hits the essence of his style at a very precise level. Squirrling loops and blank beats make this mixture of music that I want to call: addictive techno. I don't know how to describe it, but when I listen to kazooo's tracks, there is always that moment of more, that moment of don't stop this loop, because it feels and sounds so good. I am still waiting for a website with kazooos complete discography. Are there any teenage fanclubs out there? Would be great.

I've taken two of my most loved artworks from my doodlebox to illustrate the release. I am not the one to comment my own work, but feel free to leave a comment below about that.
