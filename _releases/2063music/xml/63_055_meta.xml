  <description>New artist fosilii (Alessandro They) made a some of this tracks in London and some in Italy, where he now lives. The tracks range between raw and improvised electronic and very timeless emotional sounds. This ep is first preview of more interesting things to come and have a vibe, that reminds me of even more electronic vinyls i discovered in the mid-90ies.

The artwork was made my Francesca, who calles herself effelogo. She is the girlfriend from fosilii and this artwork were created when both were distant. She in Italy, he in Great Britain. So the very idea is to have them both united in the virtual space of 2063music.
