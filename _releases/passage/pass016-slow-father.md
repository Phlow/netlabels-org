A fresh look at "thoughtful" electronica is presented by Slow aka Sergey Suokas, who already appeared in our catalog with remarkable longplayer "Strange Dreams" and hypnotic live-session "Kumar". You can expect a nostalgic 3-track journey into amazing and mysterious worlds of Suokas. Stay tuned, various divisions of FUSELab will release some very interesting releases of Sergey soon.
